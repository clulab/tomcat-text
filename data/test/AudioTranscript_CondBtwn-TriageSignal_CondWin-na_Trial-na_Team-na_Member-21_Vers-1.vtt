140
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.400
Federico Scholcover: You can go ahead and start. Whenever you're ready.

141
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.790
Participant 21: This will open the door.

142
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.480
Federico Scholcover: To get reminders of your task in the text box.

143
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.600
Participant 21: I don't have it open right now.

144
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.550
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead and press key.

145
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.420
Federico Scholcover: And then press Enter and it'll pop up for you again.

146
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.530
Participant 21: Where is it to enter

147
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.690
Participant 21: Not just

148
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.980
Federico Scholcover: Press it to make it pop up.

149
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.380
Federico Scholcover: He had There's instructions up their

150
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.110
Participant 21: Recipe for them to move on.

151
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.710
Federico Scholcover: And then you have to press enter. For the, for you to be able to interact again.

152
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.480
On each light switch to the door. Got it.

153
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:31.950
Participant 21: Like that.

154
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.960
Participant 21: It's a little leggy for me. Yeah.

155
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.590
Federico Scholcover: Hey purchasing 21 quick question. Do you have your mouse on the edge of your tables.

156
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.360
Federico Scholcover: No. Oh, OK. I keep hearing. I thought I heard you picking it up and putting it back down a lot.

157
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.680
Participant 21: Oh yeah, I mean, it's just, yeah, I'm not really yeah I've been doing

158
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.440
Federico Scholcover: Is the sensitivity to low

159
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:42.180
Participant 21: It's not the sensitivity is just more that when I'm trying to move. It's a very leggy for me. So sometimes it's like one or two seconds behind me.

160
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.770
Federico Scholcover: I see, yeah.

161
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:52.590
Participant 21: For me, at least, because sometimes I'll be walking through the hallway and then you know my screen or stop any or just German I'll be so facing the wall, kind of thing.

162
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:03.090
Participant 21: So when I tried to move them out sometimes because of the leg. I don't know what I'm pointing down the hallway where I'm supposed to go or I point back to where I keep so

163
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.550
Federico Scholcover: Well, thank you. And I think it's back to you. Right.

164
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:15.510
anagha mudigonda: Yeah, congratulations on passing the test. Now we will proceed with more training about your mission.

165
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:31.050
anagha mudigonda: Now even know the training slides. These instructions will teach you the details for the game please read through these instructions, please take your time. You can ask us questions to the training or wait until the end.

166
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.390
anagha mudigonda: It over to you.

167
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.640
Federico Scholcover: So just like last time.

168
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.880
Federico Scholcover: This will be narrated when you're actually doing this.

169
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.880
Federico Scholcover: But for now, I'm just going to let you

170
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.690
Federico Scholcover: Self forward this. Okay.

171
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.930
Federico Scholcover: So go ahead and press the spacebar, just to go forward.

172
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.200
Federico Scholcover: Just to make sure it works.

173
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:54.390
Federico Scholcover: It does not come forward.

174
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.200
Federico Scholcover: No, no. Okay, let's try one more time. How about now.

175
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.570
Federico Scholcover: Nothing.

176
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.270
Federico Scholcover: Oh, what about now try it one more time.

177
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.970
Federico Scholcover: What about the right arrow.

178
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.870
Federico Scholcover: There we go. You can just use later.

179
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.220
Participant 21: So it means when I walk in front of the door with a big demons, it will be bright

180
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.840
Participant 21: This is correct.

181
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.340
Participant 21: Yes. And then once or twice the tubing thing again.

182
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.100
No toys.

183
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.680
Participant 21: Oh,

184
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.210
Participant 21: I can move it now.

185
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.930
Participant 21: Am I supposed to answer these questions.

186
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.760
Participant 21: Right now. Okay.

187
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:43.950
Participant 21: So,

188
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.690
Participant 21: I will put it as five because

189
00:35:53.010 --> 00:36:00.450
Participant 21: I may, I may get I may get lost in the map. There's the first one. Second is the beeping thing is he mentioned that

190
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:15.000
Participant 21: Is there is no if a door doesn't beat it means that there is no one in that room but I saw my room just now from the map that one room is actually connected to another room so that me

191
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:28.800
Participant 21: That me me me me miss that room. So I'm not sure without entirety trust that BEEPING THING, BECAUSE I CAN I know that the other room is on the eastern side of the building, but I'll figure it out later.

192
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.760
Participant 21: Okay. On a scale of one to seven how interest, do you feel about your performance so far in the current mission.

193
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:48.360
Participant 21: Output s five because like I said, I'm in. I'm not sure whether I know that they built that room that's connected to another room is in the eastern site but I

194
00:36:49.440 --> 00:37:01.770
Participant 21: Yeah, I mean, I'm I can't really picture. The men all too well the buildings, a man all too well yet, so I will put it as five. And also, I'm not sure whether the response just now from the practice, it was a little bit

195
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:10.470
Participant 21: Well, it was a little like leggy for me. So I'm not sure I'll perform when the real thing starts

196
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:26.880
Participant 21: On the scale of one to seven. How would you rate your current level effort completing the mission I put it six good because I mean I'll do my best to safe, everyone. So yeah, plus six.

197
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.960
Participant 21: This. Keep in mind, you do not get any additional rescue points early Norris your points a piece of paper that time.

198
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:43.170
Participant 21: So green seven years of the team and to die. That really BP toys.

199
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:52.920
Participant 21: Maximize your points through to maximize your points not maximize the victims. Okay, any questions. No questions.

200
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.260
anagha mudigonda: Thank you for

201
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.720
anagha mudigonda: Watching

202
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.770
anagha mudigonda: The show

203
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.770
Lixiao  Huang: So those dynamic

204
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.660
Lixiao  Huang: Slice

205
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.600
Lixiao  Huang: Didn't to use that one.

206
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.760
Federico Scholcover: For his condition.

207
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.980
Lixiao  Huang: Is a condition for

208
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.390
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, no, I just downloaded the slides that were on the drive.

209
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.350
Lixiao  Huang: That's not correct.

210
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.760
Federico Scholcover: That's not correct. Like I downloaded the wrong slide for that's not correct, like the slides around

211
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.710
Lixiao  Huang: So the condition

212
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.310
For

213
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.500
Lixiao  Huang: Condition for has additional slides about the dynamic map.

214
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.870
Lixiao  Huang: We have three insert data slides Risa Sanders.

215
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.070
Lixiao  Huang: One, I guess I should have reviewed it, I'm

216
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:47.730
Federico Scholcover: Co pilot

217
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:50.490
Federico Scholcover: Let me find it.

218
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.330
Federico Scholcover: Here, let me put this over here so I can see it.

219
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.550
Federico Scholcover: To you. This is what's online.

220
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.370
Federico Scholcover: Good. She may be email it

221
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:20.400
Lixiao  Huang: She said the condition trainees ready, um, let me see.

222
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.080
Christopher Corral: Okay, slide for you to go back to slide 14 that was on that.

223
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.490
Christopher Corral: Was it

224
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.170
Christopher Corral: I, you know, I'm wondering the same thing.

225
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.460
Federico Scholcover: There's so many slides.

226
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:33.870
Federico Scholcover: Oh, it's there.

227
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.260
Yeah.

228
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.700
Christopher Corral: I

229
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.110
anagha mudigonda: Think about this Leisha

230
00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.410
Lixiao  Huang: We have three slides.

231
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.990
Lixiao  Huang: As I remember

232
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:51.930
anagha mudigonda: To 13 and 14 credit, can you go, please. Yeah, this one and the next one.

233
00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.310
Lixiao  Huang: Okay.

234
00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.160
Lixiao  Huang: Um,

235
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:04.920
Participant 21: Is this the map or is it the other big one that I saw just now.

236
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:15.690
Federico Scholcover: So it's your question. Is it this one, or is it kind of shocked about. So is it the map that you saw on the other set of PowerPoints.

237
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.040
Federico Scholcover: So is there, actually, that might be a discussion, we want to have, you were talking about.

238
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.020
Federico Scholcover: Yes, ma'am.

239
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.620
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, yeah. So do we need, I guess we need to update that huh

240
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.930
Participant 21: He's Eastern side.

241
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.100
Federico Scholcover: It's a different map.

242
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:33.300
Participant 21: Oh,

243
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.180
Federico Scholcover: That's an old map. Okay, so that needs to be updated the show. I'm guessing you're on the to do list right

244
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.300
Federico Scholcover: Yes. Okay, so that'll be updated on. Thank you.

245
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:43.980
Federico Scholcover: And

246
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.620
Lixiao  Huang: I think that's good. Um, what came along.

247
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.870
Participant 21: Okay, this is the map is it

248
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.370
Federico Scholcover: A I'll show you a better version of the map in a bit.

249
00:40:53.730 --> 00:41:11.850
Lixiao  Huang: To answer your question, yes. And it, the more important thing about this. This slide is to telling you the feature of this display it shows you your trace of your patent traveled and also your location, your actual location when you are in the map.

250
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.170
Lixiao  Huang: So you can get

251
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.830
Lixiao  Huang: immediate feedback when you are traveling through the building.

252
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:23.400
Participant 21: You check my ping. I know the last time for loving you could check that Pingu just check mine just to make sure my, it's okay.

253
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.960
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, so I've when you actually talked about latency and checking it off and on.

254
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.090
Federico Scholcover: Your at about 20 milliseconds.

255
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.640
Federico Scholcover: And within the occasional like 80 milliseconds spike.

256
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:39.930
Federico Scholcover: So you actually have. I don't think the latency could get any lower if I'm being honest.

257
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:46.410
Federico Scholcover: Okay. Um, so, oh, so I think what you're dealing with is that there is this occasional 80 millisecond spike.

258
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.600
Federico Scholcover: So it's more of a variable latency issue.

259
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:58.890
Participant 21: Sometimes that thing. That's why I have to keep checking the instructions because sometimes I miss you know that thing. We just flashed. I guess maybe the instruction Kimani early or something that so

260
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:04.080
Participant 21: Okay, especially when it comes to new room. You may show for a while and then he missed that. So,

261
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.070
Federico Scholcover: Okay. Well, the other option. The other possibility is

262
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.080
Federico Scholcover: Chris, are you familiar if carsick has to do any like processing on his end

263
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.260
Christopher Corral: Yeah, it does. If you've got a lower end graphics card, you're gonna have a little bit of some trouble with it. I know it doesn't play well with Max either

264
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.390
Participant 21: Yeah, my Mac is that she was one of us. Yes, probably what the issue is.

265
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.380
Christopher Corral: It's more I would guess it's more of a hardware issue then so much the latency.

266
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.430
Participant 21: Okay.

267
00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.850
Christopher Corral: So it'd be the rendering on your side that's causing the problem.

268
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:42.690
Participant 21: They might do like a like a task manager check. It should tell me right if my computer is like oboe working

269
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.370
Federico Scholcover: It's yeah but let's go ahead and finish the study for now.

270
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:54.030
Federico Scholcover: Um, but I think you're not going to use this computer when you're running subject so it doesn't really matter right so

271
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.690
Federico Scholcover: In fact you having these problems are actually really informative. So thank you.

272
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:07.590
Federico Scholcover: You know, like this is actually very informative. So now we know like there's another possible angle for like computational issues. I'm

273
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.060
Federico Scholcover: Not getting, where are we in the script.

274
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:23.010

278
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:54.450
Participant 21: I'm trying to skip by telling me your answer is incorrect. And it's not allowing me to Q

279
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.160
Participant 21: Oh, I just keep

Participant 21: Not if

284
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:20.310
Lixiao  Huang: You are not sure about any of the question you can say it, we can answer you just for now. That is something we need to fix. Sorry about that. Okay.

285
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.820

Participant 21: Okay, I've completed section three.

287
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:57.210
anagha mudigonda: You know, even though the training session you will play a short Minecraft mission and she will practice their skills.

288
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.340

anagha mudigonda: Overview

290
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:10.350
Federico Scholcover: Sure. Jay said. Before I do this, I noticed it was on the test. But can I just use the test version of the training mission.

291
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.010
JCR Colonna-Romano: Yeah, should be able to

292

Federico Scholcover: Alright, cool.

293
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.490
Federico Scholcover: I launched it before, as it should have asked after I launched it, but we'll see how it goes. Thank you, Jay. To

294
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.930
Federico Scholcover: Participate 21. Give me one second. To give you control of my mouse and keyboard again.

297
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.380
Participant 21: Now I'm not having any mouse control at this time.

298
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.600
Federico Scholcover: Let's go back.

299
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.240
Federico Scholcover: Let's work on

300
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:45.030
Federico Scholcover: How about now.

301
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.940
Federico Scholcover: Nothing. What about keyboard Control.

302
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.180
Participant 21: No.

303
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.120
Participant 21: barbarism W.

304

Federico Scholcover: Okay, that's weird.

305
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:08.250
Federico Scholcover: Hold on, I'm sorry, with the parsecs screen on here so you can see it as well. Yeah, that's you. Right. That has nothing to do with anything right there you are.

306
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.250
Federico Scholcover: Let's try this again. How about now.

307
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.270
Federico Scholcover: Okay, let's see, with Chris Hey Chris.

308
00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:16.740
Christopher Corral: You, sir.

309
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.360
Federico Scholcover: Give me wisdom for this.

310
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.670
Christopher Corral: Model. My question would be on the hardware side unplug and plug in the mouse.

311
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:25.080
Federico Scholcover: Oh yeah hey

312
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:26.940
Federico Scholcover: It's the mouse working on your side.

313
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.190
Participant 21: My mouse. Yeah.

314
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.940
Federico Scholcover: Like it moves around your own screen when you move it. Yeah.

315
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:33.180
Participant 21: Yeah.

316
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.190
Christopher Corral: He doesn't get from our second reconnect.

317
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.510
Federico Scholcover: Oh, OK, let's try if I kick him is he so let's have like

318
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.800
Federico Scholcover: Can you go ahead and try to reconnect to me. Well do

319
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.970
Participant 21: We need to be waiting to connect

320
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.900
Federico Scholcover: Okay, let's see if this works. Try it out.

321
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:54.810
Participant 21: Yeah, there we go.

322
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:55.680
Federico Scholcover: Okay, well,

323
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.210
Christopher Corral: Our second issue. Cool.

324
00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.720
Federico Scholcover: Whenever you're ready, you can go ahead and start.

325
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.330
Participant 21: You'll be brass you

326
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:25.740
anagha mudigonda: But

327
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.760
Participant 21: I can't do anything, anything or anything.

328
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.050
Federico Scholcover: Hey, good. I can

329
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.490
Christopher Corral: Doesn't be in the train a mission.

330
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.860
Federico Scholcover: Is it not, is it not supposed to

331
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.660
Federico Scholcover: Know, oh my god.

332
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.400
Christopher Corral: That would require a lot of work on the test bed side of things and to save them the trouble I just

333
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.300
Christopher Corral: Didn't put it in there.

334
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:53.730
Federico Scholcover: Okay, well that I remember there was a discussion some point about wanting to put it on here so that they're not surprised as to the nature of the beast.

335
00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:01.170
Federico Scholcover: Was the beef on the local version of the test bed or not, the local version is just a local version of the training mission know

336
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.460
Christopher Corral: People has never been on there.

337
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:08.490
Federico Scholcover: Okay. That's because there was that discussion about not having the training mission right or my completely miss remembering

338
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.850
Christopher Corral: It's possible that it was, um, I just tell you that it was not

339
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.050
Federico Scholcover: Okay, hold on. He

340
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:14.580
anagha mudigonda: Was

341
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.610
anagha mudigonda: Supposed to ask questions.

342
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.690
Federico Scholcover: Did we ever talked about doing incident commander queries during the training mission.

343
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:27.240
Federico Scholcover: I think

344
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.020
Federico Scholcover: We did.

345
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:29.490
Lixiao  Huang: Talk about it and

346
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:40.290
Lixiao  Huang: Chris said that he will try and we'll make it happen on the test but but I never see the outcome version of the revised the hands on practice.

347
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:47.760
Christopher Corral: Writing it right on it. I'd all I did was replicate what you asked me do the do what the test bed does and that's

348
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.690
Christopher Corral: What I was doing

349
00:50:48.900 --> 00:51:01.980
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so sorry on the to do list just change the procedure so that whoever is running subjects is aware that it's going to pause here and Naga. Do you have like some of the questions memorized, or can you find them real quick.

350
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:02.550
Do you

351
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:13.320
Participant 21: Think they do also notify the participants that, um, this has been will not be because for me. I just walked right through all those rooms, because I was assuming the thinking

352
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:19.920
Federico Scholcover: Right, right, right. So, we will I guess that is we'll discuss where to put that

353
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:27.360
Federico Scholcover: Or maybe it'll just be like during the training mission when an August talking, she'll just be like, as I know it's not going to be pure at all.

354
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:28.800
Federico Scholcover: But

355
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.170
anagha mudigonda: I asked question.

356
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:32.430
Yes.

357
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:40.410
anagha mudigonda: Which type of victim, the new save. Next, yellow, green, or whoever comes first.

358
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.550
Yellow

359
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.130
anagha mudigonda: Can you please describe

360
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:59.010
Participant 21: Okay. So I walk into a room and like for like the previous room. Our ignore the green ones first. I'll search the entire rooms for yellows. If I see yellow. I would say the yellow. If I don't see a yellow, then our can to the green in that room.

361
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.430
anagha mudigonda: Without searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

362
00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:13.320
Participant 21: I would see if where I started was the South, I would say on the north end of the building.

363
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:25.980
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with seven being extremely confident. How confident are you that you will be able to rescue all the remaining yellow victims before they die.

364
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.230
Participant 21: Six.

365
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:30.660
anagha mudigonda: Can you explain why.

366
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:41.370
Participant 21: Because, um, well I mentioned my main method would be to ignore the greens first. So I would dedicate more time to yellow. So the yellows have priority.

367
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:51.600
Participant 21: So that's why it's higher, but it's not for because I'm, I'm not familiar with the this building. So it will still take time to walk around and navigate through the rooms.

368
00:52:52.890 --> 00:53:00.900
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with seven being extremely anxious how I'm sure, do you feel about your performance so far in the current machine.

369
00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:02.820
Participant 21: Five.

370
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.430
anagha mudigonda: Yeah.

371
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:15.390
Participant 21: I should explain why because at this time. I mean, one thing would be. I'm not sure about my heart way whether that will cause an issue. The next thing is, of course,

372
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:32.010
Participant 21: Yeah, just being an unfamiliar territory of the building. I may not be able to find any hidden rooms with potentially any victims and also because there's no being so there's less queue. So I didn't literally go into each room every time. So, yeah.

373
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:41.100
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to 770 extremely high. How would you rate your current level of foot in completing this mission.

374
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.660
Participant 21: My current level what

375
00:53:43.050 --> 00:54:03.990
Participant 21: I put effort. Yeah, I'll really is seven, in a sense that I am I am not wasting time. I'm going to navigate through every door. So I'm putting I would say up with in the most amount of effort, but whether it turns out into saving all the victims that that I'm not so confident

376
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.790
anagha mudigonda: I'm newly I'm force digging.

377
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:12.600
Participant 21: Right click right

378
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.760
Federico Scholcover: On pause to see the cookie. Yeah.

379
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.190
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead and select that for me.

380

Federico Scholcover: First aid kit.

387
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.070
Federico Scholcover: Usually the first aid kit gets automatically put the correct

388
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.660
Christopher Corral: Uh, yeah, there was some things that I didn't

389

Christopher Corral: Wrap a cake on this. It was more

This map shows the room layout before the building collapsed, you have three minutes to think about how you want to approach the screen upload searching the buildings for the victims, please mark your pad on demand.

411
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.700
anagha mudigonda: Hi, can you hear me mark on the map.

Participant 21: I'm I'm knocking on my memory.

413
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.670
Federico Scholcover: I think it doesn't pop up unless you let's go over the mouse.

414
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:17.310
Federico Scholcover: Have you been holding down the mouse, the whole time. Yeah. So when you. Let's go. It'll just all once

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.390
Participant 21: No.

421
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.320
Participant 21: long pauses and a game for they will be right.

422
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.020
anagha mudigonda: Yeah yeah

423

anagha mudigonda: Thank you baby is the textbook of any

427
01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:21.660
Federico Scholcover: Kind of, I am setting up the

428
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.630
Federico Scholcover: Condition for part of it right now.

429
01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.140
Federico Scholcover: So it'll probably take another minute.

430
01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.330
Participant 21: Or on my I

431
01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:46.830
Federico Scholcover: Had so I had to stop sharing the zoom screen. Oh, you can see parse that, can't you okay so I actually have to remember to kick you. And then I'll react you to per sec um

432
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:55.950
Christopher Corral: It's not that big a deal for me because I mean they've already seen the map of the building and you can't doesn't have victims on top of it. So it doesn't show them the layout of anything.

433
01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:07.800
Federico Scholcover: Right. Hold on, I'm having problems connecting to test, but on the other computer I am on the VPN. The this computers on the test bed. Chris, you have the server address again.

434
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.760
Christopher Corral: It's assist.sec.edu

435
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:15.060
Federico Scholcover: Colon to 556506

436
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.810
Federico Scholcover: Okay, sir. That's that explains that. Okay.

437
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.400
Federico Scholcover: What I mean, and so, just as a I'm in his body. Okay.

438
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.280
Federico Scholcover: Chris, how do I fly again.

439
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.490
Christopher Corral: Double Top the spacebar.

440
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.990
Federico Scholcover: Got it.

441
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:40.530
Thank you.

442
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.260
Christopher Corral: Freddie depending on which version of Falcon is in there.

443
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:50.670
Christopher Corral: Your character may trigger the

444
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:57.780
Christopher Corral: plat map. Okay, make sure. Also, make sure it's adjusted for the reduced Minecraft window.

445
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.930
Christopher Corral: Because if you put the position, the observer using the full screen Minecraft window, it's going to

446
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.100
Christopher Corral: Cut our part of the map.

447
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.800
Federico Scholcover: I remember I got to check it on the purchase me computer

448
01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:14.850
Christopher Corral: Yeah, I'm just, I'm saying, like, make sure that your because I didn't. I don't think I brought that up when we were going over it, that it has to

449
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.170
Christopher Corral: Have the reduced Minecraft like

450
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:23.970
Federico Scholcover: I might be misunderstand what you're saying.

451
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:32.130
Christopher Corral: So you know how when we put up the map that the participant draws on and the word document and Minecraft on the same screen.

452
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:36.180
Christopher Corral: Mm hmm. That's what I mean that I have to resize Minecraft.

453
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.380
Federico Scholcover: Oh,

454
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.010
Christopher Corral: Make sure you have adjust the observer based off of that resized Minecraft.

455
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:44.520
Federico Scholcover: I see hey tab should be opening the map right

456
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.720
Christopher Corral: Did you have to have the character added, you probably don't.

457
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:54.540
Federico Scholcover: Know, okay. Well, good thing we're piloting I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen.

458
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.460
Christopher Corral: Yeah, go ahead and help you out here.

459
01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.690
Federico Scholcover: Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm actually just kicked my computer on par suck.

460
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:02.760
Christopher Corral: Yeah, alright.

461
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:04.710
Christopher Corral: So,

462
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.640
Christopher Corral: Let's get it right.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.500
Federico Scholcover: Okay. And do I have to do that every time. No.

467
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.520
Federico Scholcover: You do not

468
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.110
Federico Scholcover: I think you just add

469
01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:34.530
Christopher Corral: Oh wait, are you playing on the research.

470
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:36.450
Federico Scholcover: Which one is the observer. Yeah, this is three.

471
01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.060
Federico Scholcover: And do I have to add assists three to

472
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.790
Christopher Corral: Do that right here.

473
01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.700
Federico Scholcover: Oh cool, okay to have to do anything on the observer side.

474
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:51.870
Christopher Corral: Now,

475
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:11.550

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.170
Federico Scholcover: Hey, why is that, there we go.

478

Federico Scholcover: Alright, just give me another minute because I got a line this up.

480
01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:34.410
Participant 21: And when it comes my turn to start hosting this show me how you line things up and everything.

481
01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.510
Christopher Corral: Oh shirt, they will go through all this again.

482
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.740
Federico Scholcover: Lots of tears.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.710
Christopher Corral: Yeah, hey,

484
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:43.230

Christopher Corral: I don't need to be below it.

490
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.570
Federico Scholcover: How do I get below it.

491
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.240
Federico Scholcover: Just keep walking around.

492
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:58.230
Christopher Corral: Well, the whole box itself is outlined in a black wall.

493
01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.040
Federico Scholcover: Yeah.

494
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.120
Christopher Corral: You can either walk to it or you can just break through it. I left clicking

495
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.090
Federico Scholcover: Okay. It doesn't matter if I break through it up. I'm falling

496
01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:12.810
Federico Scholcover: Okay, we might have to have a discussion about how to

497
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.930
Federico Scholcover: How does

498
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:17.910
Christopher Corral: Did you trigger the player trail.

499
01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:26.880
Christopher Corral: Twice yet, don't worry about that. That's what I was trying to mention earlier, depending on which version of Falcon is in there. I fixed that. And the new version that I sent to JCR so

500
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.470
Federico Scholcover: I won't be doing that.

501
01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:34.410
Christopher Corral: Now you'll be fine. Next, Next time, you'll just stay on top of that platform because I have the map up

502
01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:35.310
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

503
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.890
Christopher Corral: Cool. You're good day for this pilot. Don't worry about it.

504
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:47.040
Federico Scholcover: It's fixed. Okay. A participant 21 go ahead and reconnect to my computer and I have to re share the screen to everyone so

505
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:49.740
Federico Scholcover: We can

506
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.960
Federico Scholcover: Give me a minute.

507
01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:56.490
Okay.

508
01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:05.160
Federico Scholcover: So we're connected. Again, you should have control of my mouse and keyboard and. Whenever you are ready, just go ahead and start.

509
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.410
Participant 21: On the show of your mouse.

510

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:14.970
Federico Scholcover: One sec.

513
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:21.840
Federico Scholcover: It said

514
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:28.530
Federico Scholcover: My computer just did something I just had an air. What's that field request to host

515
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:32.160
Federico Scholcover: That's weird.

516
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:34.140
Federico Scholcover: Chris ideas.

517
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:36.420
Christopher Corral: A just restart per sec

518
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.580
Christopher Corral: Okay, that's usually

519
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.070
Participant 21: At something or

520
01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.320
Federico Scholcover: Try knows me try to reconnect.

521

Okay.

522
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.890
Participant 21: We need to connect

523
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:51.510
Federico Scholcover: OK, cool. So you're connected. I give you keyboard and mouse. Try it.

524
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:53.940
Federico Scholcover: Nothing.

525
01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:55.050
Nothing.

526
01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.080
Participant 21: Me tribe is my site. Okay, thank you guys again, ya know, my mouse works fine.

527
01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:09.840
Federico Scholcover: Okay, well, you know, this is great practice for what we have actual technical issues with real participants. Alright.

528
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.800
Participant 21: So both my mouse my trackpad and my keyboard doesn't work on for for you.

529
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:26.220
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so there's there's a, like a firewall issue. Oh, I'm making stuff up there is an issue somewhere between my second year per sec

530
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:34.710
Federico Scholcover: So let me try kick me one more time. Try this.

531
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:38.310
Participant 21: I'll try restarting my parsecs to, again, just in case it's

532
01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.050
Federico Scholcover: Yep, that's a good idea.

533
01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:45.570
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so this happens when we're running an actual participant. What do we do

534
01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:54.660
Christopher Corral: If you can't solve it. This is a cut them loose and pay them for a time spent kind of situation, I believe we shall correct me if I'm wrong, but I think

535
01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:02.010
Christopher Corral: The, the thing that we had laid out was if it's a technical technical issue on our side that we can't resolve we paid them for however long we've been here.

536
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:03.720
Lixiao  Huang: Yes, that's right.

537
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:05.670
Participant 21: What could be causing this issue.

538
01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:06.720
Federico Scholcover: Hold on. Is it working.

539
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.790
Federico Scholcover: No. Okay, so I hope is, it's that you're using a Mac. Let me kick you Chris can you reconnect to me.

540
01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:15.600
Christopher Corral: Yeah, sure thing.

Participant 21: In work for me just now, though.

542
01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:19.500
Federico Scholcover: Oh, it did right before I kicked you

543
01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:23.250
Participant 21: Know, I mean just not when we were playing the task bit and everything.

544
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:24.690
Federico Scholcover: Oh, yeah.

545
01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:25.830
Participant 21: I'm sorry.

546
01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:28.590

01:09:30.150 --> 01:09:30.360
Federico Scholcover: Oh,

549

Christopher Corral: Yeah, has a launch party because I closed it after that.

550
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:40.080
Federico Scholcover: Right. Because what I want to figure out is it, is it a me issue, right, try it out, Chris.

551
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.180
Federico Scholcover: Okay. So, no, you have to figure out, so

552
01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:46.440
Christopher Corral: I think it's Mac.

553
01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:51.360
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so then, do we have to change the recruiting parameters.

554
01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:53.520
Christopher Corral: It's a certain

555
01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:04.740
Christopher Corral: I believe I believe fatty and Rob came across an issue. I could be wrong. Someone, somewhere posted something that older versions of Mac have problems with parsecs.

556
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.510
Participant 21: So mine is a myself was up to date. It's a 316 model.

557
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.110
Federico Scholcover: That would probably be an older Mac at this point.

558
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:13.740
Yeah.

559
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:22.470
Christopher Corral: I think Glenn has also run into problems with our second back to because he runs Mac is this primary experiment computer

560
01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:28.290
Federico Scholcover: Okay. What happens if I give you both control of my mouse and keyboard. Oh, it just

561
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.220
Participant 21: They can

562
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:29.880
I book.

563
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:34.530
Federico Scholcover: Okay, the show. How would you like to continue

564
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.520
Lixiao  Huang: Restate the problem.

565
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.550
Federico Scholcover: There is something wrong between

566
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:47.670
Federico Scholcover: At some. I don't know why but parts like is no longer letting participant 21 control my computer.

567
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:54.300
Lixiao  Huang: Dash shouldn't be an issue because he had control over your computer earlier.

568
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:54.990
Lixiao  Huang: So that

569
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.670
Lixiao  Huang: Can be a computer issue.

570
01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:03.750
Federico Scholcover: Right. But I've just been able to get crystal work. So I don't know what else the issue would be

571
01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:05.670
Lixiao  Huang: Is there a way that you

572
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:07.410
Federico Scholcover: Oh, it's working.

573
01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:12.750
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, okay. Sorry, I guess if we just disconnect and reconnect 30 times it'll work.

574
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.160
Federico Scholcover: Um, that is not something I'm happy with as a solution, but

575
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:27.030
Federico Scholcover: Let's talk about it after this and just enjoy the fact that it's working for now. Does that sound like a plan to everyone.

576
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.250
Participant 21: Working for me. So yeah, sure.

577
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.100
anagha mudigonda: Okay. Okay. Let me read the procedure.

578
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:35.550
Federico Scholcover: Oh yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry. I lost track of everything.

579
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:42.240
anagha mudigonda: No problem. So as you can see we have posted your annotated map. Please make sure you can see the whole map.

580
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:48.390
anagha mudigonda: Yeah. Also we have posted a notepad that you can use to take notes if you like to

581
01:11:49.200 --> 01:12:03.420
anagha mudigonda: And they will ask you a couple of questions to our mission. Please make sure you attend to this questions and answer every question or only this mission will be stop. During this time, so you will not lose any machine time

582
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:11.010
anagha mudigonda: Lastly, I want to remain remind you, not to hide your face during the mission. If you can

583
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:20.310
anagha mudigonda: Please don't drink or eat anything during the next 10 minutes if you like, you can have something to drink before we start.

584
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.070
Participant 21: I am good. We can start

585
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.890
anagha mudigonda: Ready. Ready.

586
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.340
Federico Scholcover: Yes, I skipped a few steps or turns out

587
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.500
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so whenever you're ready, is the mouse working

588
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.660
Federico Scholcover: Yes.

589
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.060
Federico Scholcover: All right. Whenever you're ready, go ahead click back to game.

590
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.910
Federico Scholcover: And then push the button to begin

591
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:02.040
Participant 21: Still

592
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:03.690
Participant 21: This one.

593
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.660
Participant 21: I'm lagging right now at this time on something.

594
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:30.090
Federico Scholcover: Unfortunately, I can't actually get diagnostics. When you're interacting with it.

595
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.330
Participant 21: The show's therefore

596
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.940
Christopher Corral: Not to interrupt this but can anyone else verify that it looks like the timers county down unusually fast.

597
01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.620
Federico Scholcover: It's skipping every other second

598
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:21.510
Christopher Corral: Okay, that's what I thought.

599
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.150
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, I thought I noticed that a while back.

600
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.830
Federico Scholcover: But now it's not so maybe it's happening sporadically

601
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.250
Christopher Corral: It looks like every couple of seconds, it drops. Me too. Yeah.

602
01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:35.070
anagha mudigonda: Yeah, he was walking

603
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.810
Christopher Corral: No, I was isn't working, either.

604
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:37.740
Yeah.

605
01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.350
Federico Scholcover: It's a car here.

606
01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:49.710
Participant 21: Also the map. Doesn't look like it looks like there's an obstruction of the Eastern and as I couldn't go in there just though which is not reflect document so

607
01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:52.950
Federico Scholcover: that's by design.

608
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:56.490
JCR Colonna-Romano: I'm wondering if there's some interaction, because there are two players in the game.

609
01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.650
Federico Scholcover: Well, on the other screen. I haven't been. Pause

610
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.300
Federico Scholcover: I don't know why that would matter.

611
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.260
But

612
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.200
Federico Scholcover: I got soon every three two to three seconds.

613
01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:14.520
Federico Scholcover: Yeah.

614
01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:16.950
Federico Scholcover: You're just going, yeah.

615
01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:23.010
Participant 21: I'm, how can I suppose you could talk design, then I guess we bit tricky, but I can get to be

616
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.960
Federico Scholcover: Alright. So Tracy, our question for you then because today's what Wednesday.

617
01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:32.460
Federico Scholcover: Should we hold off on recruitment for a little longer.

618
01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.740
Federico Scholcover: Because we were going to start Monday.

619
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.540
Federico Scholcover: Or at least

620
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.860
Federico Scholcover: Try to start Monday.

621
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.350
JCR Colonna-Romano: Something we haven't tested this before.

622
01:16:43.800 --> 01:17:01.410
JCR Colonna-Romano: Right, with everything else. So I mean, every time we make some changes as possibilities that things other things, there'll be interactions. We didn't understand. So we'll have to look into this and see, you know, whether or not it's something difficult to fix or not. I don't, I don't know.

623
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.610
Okay.

624
01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:25.680
Federico Scholcover: Here's a question. Is it actually going. Is it skipping a number or

625
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.500
Federico Scholcover: Like is it switching every second.

626
01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.000
Federico Scholcover: Because I'm wondering if it's if it's the clock going fast or

627
01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:41.700
Federico Scholcover: That doesn't matter.

628
01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:05.220
Federico Scholcover: Hey, that's weird.

629
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:13.860
Federico Scholcover: So the map character got sent to the end of the mission. And you can see it in the top right, but the actual character didn't get sent to the mission and

630
01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:15.000
So I

631
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:17.490
JCR Colonna-Romano: was confused.

632
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:18.780
JCR Colonna-Romano: Between

633
01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:35.400
Federico Scholcover: The players. Okay, so the way Chris described it to me was that the I could move the map character around as long as the participant character was the one that press the button is that kind of the assumption I should still work under

634
01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:43.050
Christopher Corral: Yeah, that's that was my understanding of how the testbed tags and identifies the player for data collection.

635
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.990
Christopher Corral: It's whoever pushes the button.

636
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.330
Federico Scholcover: Is it related to the fact that I felt too far. Maybe, I don't know.

637
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.760
Federico Scholcover: I guess it's a thing you have to look at. Okay.

638
01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.190
Federico Scholcover: So,

639
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.980
Federico Scholcover: You're actually out of time, so I'm just gonna disconnect you

640
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:01.410
Christopher Corral: Is it at a time, though.

641
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.310
Federico Scholcover: It was

642
01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.310
Christopher Corral: Because we weren't actually keeping track of how long

643
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:06.330
Federico Scholcover: No, I

644
01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:08.490
Federico Scholcover: Was counting it was going way too quick.

645
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:11.400
Federico Scholcover: But

646
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:12.930
So,

647
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.300
anagha mudigonda: All right.

648
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:19.680
Rob Hyland: Only been seven minutes and 27 seconds since mission start

649
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.840
Federico Scholcover: Have you been timing it by hand.

650
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.660
Federico Scholcover: Yeah. Okay. Cool.

651
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:32.640
Federico Scholcover: OK, so I guess not a Europe, yes.

652
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:42.210
anagha mudigonda: All right, you've completed the nation. Next please pull up the survey and proceed with service Section five, let us know. Once you're done.

653
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.260
Participant 21: Okay, I'm done.

654
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:12.030
anagha mudigonda: As we are getting better information to you can take a short three minute break. If you like to use the restroom. Let us know if you need a longer thing.

655
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:14.280
Participant 21: I'll grab some water.

656
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:50.430
Federico Scholcover: Oh hey fatty, I just noticed that you're sending chat messages I can't see chat messages, while I'm running them.

657
01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:53.610
Federico Scholcover: But I guess if someone can relay them.

658
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:55.230
Federico Scholcover: That would be

659
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.750
Federico Scholcover: Cool, too.

660
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.260
Participant 21: Okay, I'm ready.

661
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.550
anagha mudigonda: Do you have any questions before we proceed.

662
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.480
No.

663
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.300
anagha mudigonda: Great, let's proceed permission.

664
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.200
anagha mudigonda: Can you post the map to the packets thing.

665
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.190
Participant 21: So in this case I should be on zoom right Justin.

666
01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:22.560
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, but you shouldn't see anything. I'm doing right now.

667
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:28.260
Federico Scholcover: Sure. So map, map.

668
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:33.570
Federico Scholcover: Again, I'm gonna share my screen.

669
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:38.970
Federico Scholcover: And you remember how to annotate it like crazy.

670
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.640
Federico Scholcover: All right you ready

671
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:43.710
Participant 21: I'm ready.

672
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:45.510
Participant 21: Okay ready

673
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:46.770
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead.

674
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.550
Participant 21: I'm logging in. Yeah, just so you know.

675
01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:30.300
Participant 21: Then

676
01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:42.960
anagha mudigonda: Any questions before we proceed.

677
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.220
anagha mudigonda: Know,

678
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:54.540
Participant 21: What we want question is, so there may be unexpected obstructions, I guess, is from from the first trial. That's what I kind of figured

679
01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.130
Participant 21: Okay.

680
01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:05.520
anagha mudigonda: Please pull up the survey and complete survey Section six, let us know. Once we're done. Okay.

681
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:17.280
Participant 21: Okay.

682
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.240
anagha mudigonda: Thank you.

683
01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:34.530
anagha mudigonda: Ready to load the second machine. Again, the set the session will automatically time out once 10 minutes that up. We I'm ready. Are you ready. Sure.

684
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.110
Federico Scholcover: So participant 21 go ahead and reconnect to me on a sec.

685
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.560
Participant 21: Okay. One quick question is since a timer on the game is not accurate, um,

686
01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.350
Participant 21: Because

687
01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:04.560
Federico Scholcover: Okay, you can talk now that's weird. Let it unlike

688
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:17.490
Participant 21: Yet, because then the yellow victims may die earlier than expected. Actually, right, because if the time of the gate is faster than normal. I may not have exactly five minutes to save the yellows.

689
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:30.540
Federico Scholcover: That's, I think, okay, for the purposes of what we're piloting for which is that 191 when you practice to we got to figure out what still needs to be done right.

690
01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:38.130
Federico Scholcover: So just look at the timer and if it hits. Just try to play. As if. Whatever. Five minutes that they're pointing the timer for five minutes. Okay.

691
01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.610
Federico Scholcover: Cool. Okay, so I'm gonna give you control of my mouse and keyboard again.

692
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:47.310
Federico Scholcover: You should have control the mouse and keyboard, maybe

693
01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.520
Federico Scholcover: No. All right, let's see, here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna kick you.

694
01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.380
Participant 21: Out you kicking me out. I'll close my parse it out, we open it again.

695
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:01.950
Federico Scholcover: Okay. Okay, so maybe it's the kicking process that has a problem.

696
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.140
Participant 21: Maybe

697
01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.070
Participant 21: It's close quit.

698
01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.850
Participant 21: Or say is coming up for me.

699
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:21.540
Participant 21: Okay, are you ready for me to connect

700
01:27:21.690 --> 01:27:22.410
Federico Scholcover: Yep, go for it.

701
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.120
Federico Scholcover: Okay, try it out.

702
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:35.400
Participant 21: I'm seeing on my there is a yellow thing on top, same connection error.

703
01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.220
Federico Scholcover: I don't have that.

704
01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.650
Federico Scholcover: Okay, you know what I'm going to restart person as well.

705
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:44.580
Participant 21: Okay.

706
01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:46.320
Federico Scholcover: I will hope for the best.

707
01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:47.760
Participant 21: How did the same for me.

708
01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.250
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead and reconnect.

709
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.830
Federico Scholcover: Alright, let's cross our fingers here.

710
01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:22.680
Participant 21: Yeah.

711
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:36.570
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so I think from now I will do is if this air pops up. We will ask the participant to restart carsick will restart per sec and then we'll say a little prayer to whatever data. We believe in sound good.

712
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:38.820
anagha mudigonda: Yeah.

713
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:40.500
Federico Scholcover: Cool, I

714
01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:50.880
JCR Colonna-Romano: Make a suggestion. I wonder if after you set up the map, you get out of the game. If you don't need to do any other things in the game and maybe the time award better

715
01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:56.910
JCR Colonna-Romano: Fix, but maybe something that might make this session, a little more useful. So

716
01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:00.060
Federico Scholcover: Once I get the map setup. You want me to just connect the map character.

717
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.910
JCR Colonna-Romano: Yeah, if you don't need to do anything else. Yeah.

718
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.060
Federico Scholcover: Okay, I think. And then what do you want me to reconnect them.

719
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.610
JCR Colonna-Romano: Oh, but will that stop the map for working

720
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.710
Christopher Corral: Yeah, the character needs to be there.

721
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:11.460
And everyone

722
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.260
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

723
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:30.720
Christopher Corral: I wonder JCR we could put like an agent character out there that wouldn't involve any of the research team having to do it like it's just perpetually up there, looking down and we just

724
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:31.830
Christopher Corral: connect to it.

725
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.420
Federico Scholcover: That would be

726
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.040
Christopher Corral: Another time

727
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:38.190
JCR Colonna-Romano: For another conversation about how we can fix this.

728
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:41.220
Federico Scholcover: That would be wonderful, though. Okay.

729
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:45.690
Federico Scholcover: Participant 21 whenever you're ready, go ahead and press back again.

730
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:50.790
Federico Scholcover: And if you're whenever you're ready to start. Go ahead and press that button.

731
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:58.650
Federico Scholcover: Oh, what if it's because he hit the start button multiple times. He did that last time, too.

732
01:29:59.190 --> 01:29:59.700
Yeah.

733
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.580
Participant 21: Started this

734
01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.570
Christopher Corral: Not my

735
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.980
Christopher Corral: It's actually

736
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:08.610
Federico Scholcover: It's skipping a say. I just thought, skip a second I think

737
01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:14.460
Christopher Corral: Yep, there it is again, try it again. Since you haven't done anything I would relaunch this and see

738
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.580
Federico Scholcover: If. Okay. What's that, oh, on

739
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:21.480
Federico Scholcover: So I'm just gonna so

740
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:24.150
Participant 21: Click the button once a cut. There's a timer. Okay.

741
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:31.080
Federico Scholcover: Got it. Yeah, just click it once, because I have have have any of us made that done that, where we've hit the start button multiple times.

742
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:31.980
Christopher Corral: I don't think so.

743
01:30:34.230 --> 01:30:35.910
Rob Hyland: You never, never, never did that.

744
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.630
Federico Scholcover: Hey JC here.

745
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:43.050
Federico Scholcover: Do I have to start the trial all over again. Okay. Just hit Run mission.

746
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:49.260
JCR Colonna-Romano: I think I would start to try it over again just to make sure it's clean.

747
01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:49.980
Okay.

748
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:58.380
Federico Scholcover: Stop trial choose experiment you already have to recreate it. Correct. Yeah, I got it.

749
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.840
JCR Colonna-Romano: We run the restart the mission.

750
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:06.180
Participant 21: So many one thing to tell the park classical because like for me when I did the test.

751
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:13.170
Participant 21: That the trial runs previously when I hit the green button immediately the thing. Open the door opens right so maybe for

752
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:30.720
Participant 21: Participants I myself who may not have played the game before when we start the actual trial when we hit the green button and nothing reacts. We may not see the timer it or we may just unintentionally. Just keep hitting because we think that, you know, it just didn't register or something.

753
01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:33.180
Participant 21: Yeah, maybe you could tell them to

754
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:35.010
Participant 21: But yeah, for me to

755
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:41.280
Federico Scholcover: See, you know, going back to that discussion we're having about on is it launching he's lunch.

756
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:43.440
Federico Scholcover: Oh just been

757
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:46.620
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

758
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:52.230
Federico Scholcover: So let me set up the PIP character.

759
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.460
Federico Scholcover: And Chris, I should change the game mode, every time I do this, correct.

760
01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.500
Christopher Corral: Yes. Okay.

761
01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.440
Federico Scholcover: Just wondering if that was the other problem.

762
01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.130
Federico Scholcover: Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

763
01:32:27.090 --> 01:32:28.260
Federico Scholcover: Don't do anything just yet.

764
01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:50.640
Okay.

765
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.160
Federico Scholcover: So I'm gonna give you maybe this will work.

766
01:32:57.630 --> 01:32:58.710
Federico Scholcover: Doesn't work, try it out.

767
01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:00.270
Participant 21: My mouse control.

768
01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:00.840
Uh huh.

769
01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:02.100
Participant 21: Yeah.

770
01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.500
Federico Scholcover: Works. All right, go ahead and try starting

771
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.720
Federico Scholcover: So go back to the game and then just right click it, or click the mission. Start button just one time.

772
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:22.320
Participant 21: I'm not see myself on the moving that way.

773
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:24.420
Federico Scholcover: Oh, you actually shouldn't see yourself.

774
01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:28.140
Participant 21: I thought, I thought the men are supposed to tell me

775
01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:30.030
Participant 21: If

776
01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:35.490
Federico Scholcover: It actually does the clock look like looks like it's working correctly.

777
01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.990
Participant 21: So okay, so it's my fault that I shouldn't I should kill it only once. Got it.

778
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:45.780
Federico Scholcover: Now, just let participants know until that's a thing that gets

779
01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:53.850
Federico Scholcover: It's funny that that's never happened before.

780
01:33:56.190 --> 01:33:57.480
Federico Scholcover: Just, just skip 20

781
01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:07.740
anagha mudigonda: I'm not seeing

782
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.840
anagha mudigonda: The dynamic

783
01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:12.750
Federico Scholcover: Right, because that comes in at the seven and a half minute mark.

784
01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.710
Rob Hyland: I think it is moving faster.

785
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:20.400
Rob Hyland: Than 56 seconds in real time.

786
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.140
Federico Scholcover: Oh,

787
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:23.700
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

788
01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:26.430
anagha mudigonda: Yeah.

789
01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:29.940
anagha mudigonda: Me.

790
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:31.860
Federico Scholcover: Neither here.

791
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:42.270
anagha mudigonda: Okay, I can spend 25 please describe which type of test the new save next yellow green all whoever comes first.

792
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:53.070
Participant 21: Hello, because yellow will die in five minutes. Green will not die. So if I say if I save all the yellows and greens together.

793
01:34:53.550 --> 01:35:06.000
Participant 21: There may be yellows in the further and of the building that may die, so I will primarily try this, the method I'm thinking of doing is our walk around the building save all the yellows first any additional time, then I will save the greens.

794
01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:12.390
anagha mudigonda: Mm hmm. Searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

795
01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:18.330
Participant 21: I believe I'm in the women's bathroom. So in the middle, middle section of the building.

796
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:29.280
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven be extremely confident. How confident are you that you will rescue all the remaining kilo victims before they die.

797
01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.240
Participant 21: Six because

798
01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:45.630
Participant 21: I'm in that there may be unforeseen obstructions, which may require me to go around them and during that time I me lose my spatial orientation. So I'll say six

799
01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:55.260
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven being extremely anxious. How do you feel about your performance so far in the current mission.

800
01:35:56.490 --> 01:36:05.040
Participant 21: Five because I'm slowly getting familiar with the terrain laid out layout from the previous mission. So I would say about five

801
01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:15.420
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven. The seven being extremely high. How would you rate your current level of effort and completing this mission.

802
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:27.390
Participant 21: I would say five as well because of the once again I'm slowly figuring out the Building Layout. Um, it wasn't as so called stress with the first first attempt

803
01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.480
anagha mudigonda: Even for speaking

804
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:20.520
Federico Scholcover: A heads up.

805
01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.580
Participant 21: Once again, not see myself in the movie neck on the top right so

806
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:18.930
Federico Scholcover: Do you see

807
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:25.350
Federico Scholcover: The little red streak that's moving around. No. Okay, so go down that hallway.

808
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:31.770
Federico Scholcover: To see how at the very tip of that new yellow line. It's a little red

809
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:38.700
Participant 21: I'm just seeing my drawing. That's all I'm not even seeing any yellow line at all.

810
01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.290
Participant 21: You don't. Oh.

811
01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:42.510
Participant 21: Sorry, yeah.

812
01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:43.170
Participant 21: I got it.

813
01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.280
Federico Scholcover: Okay, cool.

814
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.230
Participant 21: I'll get it wrong. Wrong.

815
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.910
Participant 21: Oops.

816
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:50.670
Participant 21: Like it together. So

817
01:38:59.490 --> 01:38:59.850
We go.

818
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.540
Once again,

819
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:15.870
anagha mudigonda: I just went, you went one please describe which type of victim. Will you say next yellow green or whoever comes first.

820
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.440
Yellow

821
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.110
anagha mudigonda: Because

822
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:24.840
Participant 21: Because yellow dying yellow as a time limit, and they would die green victims will never die. So

823
01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.570
Participant 21: Um, yes. That's the only reason and yellow carries more points as well.

824
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:33.360
Participant 21: So any time.

825
01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:39.630
Participant 21: After saving as much yellow. Second, I will then look for the greens.

826
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:47.430
anagha mudigonda: Little searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

827
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:53.130
Participant 21: I believe them the MO. I can see the map them on the eastern eastern end of the building.

828
01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:58.920
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with seven being extremely confident

829
01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.010
anagha mudigonda: confident are you that you will be able to rescue all the remaining yellow victims before they die.

830
01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:09.990
Participant 21: Until five five because

831
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:16.980
Participant 21: I got confused. They're just now for for a bit. So I may have wasted some time, but um yeah i'll put her on five

832
01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:27.090
anagha mudigonda: Mm hmm. On a scale of one to 717 extremely anxious how anxious, do you feel about your performance so far in the current mission.

833
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:49.920
Participant 21: I would say five as well. I'm in. Once again, I did get confused there and I'm looking at, I may have skipped the room on the western side but um yeah i mean if i if i will pay more attention to the movie Matt Matt Matt on the top on the top, I would have probably did a little better.

834
01:40:51.300 --> 01:41:01.590
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven. The seven being extremely high. How would you rate your current level of effort in completing this mission six

835
01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:09.600
Participant 21: Because I'm I am trying to find them trying to desperately look for every room.

836
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:13.290
anagha mudigonda: Even for thinking

837
01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:41.940
Participant 21: Don't think this room had a dog will be, by the way.

838
01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:43.710
Participant 21: You guys

839
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.000
Participant 21: Once again,

840
01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:54.720
anagha mudigonda: Type of victim would you say next yellow green or whoever comes first.

841
01:43:55.170 --> 01:44:00.090
Participant 21: Green because I think I pass the five minute mark and all the yellows would have been did

842
01:44:01.650 --> 01:44:06.450
anagha mudigonda: Without searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

843
01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.460
Participant 21: Somewhere in the eastern side, I think, yeah, somewhere in Eastern side northeastern maybe

844
01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:22.110
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven. The seven being extremely confident. How confident are you that you will rescue all the remaining clean victims.

845
01:44:23.970 --> 01:44:34.800
Participant 21: How confident. I am. I'll put around for because I need to backtrack to where I came from. And because on the moving map, um,

846
01:44:35.610 --> 01:44:47.730
Participant 21: I can, I cannot reset the movie map so they may be victims that read victims are past be misty that I, you know, may not be aware that it's there because if I can reset them. The yellow lines I would be able to know

847
01:44:48.900 --> 01:45:03.300
Participant 21: I can search and a grid pattern and of systematically save all the green victims, but because now the map is so congested yellow. It's a bit difficult to know where I have been and where have not been to look for green victims.

848
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:13.470
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven being extremely anxious. How do you feel about your performance so far in the current machine.

849
01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:19.440
Participant 21: I would say six because I, I think. I mean, the time, the time is up, and

850
01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.970
Participant 21: However, the remaining yellows were funded already

851
01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:35.760
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven being extremely high. How would you rate your current level of effort and completing this mission six

852
01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:39.870
Participant 21: Because I was still doing my best to save as many green victims as I can.

853
01:49:49.290 --> 01:49:56.610
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, and it looks like the map character got sent to the wrong spot instead of you see mission so

854
01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:03.690
Federico Scholcover: I believe you're up.

855
01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:04.740
Yes.

856
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:10.740
anagha mudigonda: Again, you will have three. Sorry.

857
01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:21.720
anagha mudigonda: All right, either completed the second mission. Next please fill out the survey and proceed with service section seven, let us know. Once you're done.

858
01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.390
Participant 21: Section seven is complete.

859
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:41.610
anagha mudigonda: Do you have any questions before we proceed.

860
01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.780
anagha mudigonda: Great, let's proceed to mission.

861
01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:47.460
anagha mudigonda: Crazy.

862
01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.540
anagha mudigonda: Can you please post it again. Sure.

863
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:58.740
Federico Scholcover: So let me ask a procedural thing. Chris, are you doing the

864
01:51:01.050 --> 01:51:04.530
Federico Scholcover: Condition for setup, before, after, at the map trying

865
01:51:06.210 --> 01:51:07.170
Christopher Corral: I would do it after

866
01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:08.010
Christopher Corral: Okay.

867
01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:10.920
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, I've been trying to do it before and it's just not going well.

868
01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:16.650
Christopher Corral: No, just I there's gonna be some waiting periods for them. So that's just kind of

869
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.510
Christopher Corral: The nature of things.

870
01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:25.440
Federico Scholcover: This what it is. I'm cool. All right. You have your handy dandy annotation tool ready

871
01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.360
Participant 21: So go back to. Okay.

872
01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:31.710
Participant 21: So,

873
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.570
Federico Scholcover: All right, I'm gonna go ahead and press start. So you can go ahead and get started as well.

874
01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:51.150
Participant 21: Assuming that all the distractions. I see him right

875
01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:10.230
Federico Scholcover: You, we actually have never talked about what we're going to save that. If you ask. Um, I think the best. So as an experimenter and as a future experimenter, the answer's no. I'm right.

876
01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:14.550
Federico Scholcover: So if a participant asks that.

877
01:52:15.930 --> 01:52:21.270
Federico Scholcover: I guess the best answer is we don't know. Is that what we're going to go with as a group.

878
01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.920
Christopher Corral: What was the question I missed

879
01:52:23.190 --> 01:52:24.870
Federico Scholcover: He wants to know if the obstructions change.

880
01:52:27.630 --> 01:52:30.990
Christopher Corral: I think, for he says default is the map that you see is

881
01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.190
preeclampsia.

882
01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.080
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

883
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:38.490
Federico Scholcover: Okay, that's a much better answer.

884
01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:41.460
Participant 21: I sorry I didn't catch it. And so what do you think

885
01:52:42.930 --> 01:52:46.800
Federico Scholcover: For the map that you're drawing on is what it looked like before the building collapsed.

886
01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.630
Participant 21: Know, so I'm saying between the missions are the Mets exactly the same.

887
01:52:52.230 --> 01:52:53.130
Federico Scholcover: Right, so

888
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:54.870
Christopher Corral: That's what, that's our answer.

889
01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:55.620
To yeah

890
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.300
Christopher Corral: Okay.

891
01:52:59.460 --> 01:52:59.700
Christopher Corral: But

892
01:52:59.730 --> 01:53:00.240
Participant 21: I am

893
01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.750
Participant 21: Do my path, based on the assumption that yeah okay

894
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:11.130
Federico Scholcover: Y'all set

895
01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:11.550
Yeah.

896
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:13.230
Okay.

897
01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.940
Federico Scholcover: So I take a screenshot.

898
01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.590
anagha mudigonda: Any questions before we proceed.

899
01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:26.790
No.

900
01:53:27.810 --> 01:53:40.320
Christopher Corral: I have a quick question. Friday when you press the button to bring up the map intervention, would you mind explaining the components of it like the trail and then the red dot and just

901
01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:40.950
Participant 21: Been already

902
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.320
Christopher Corral: Okay, I know, but just for practice.

903
01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.940
Christopher Corral: Yeah, it was a procedural practice.

904
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:46.530
Federico Scholcover: Oh, does that

905
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.830
Federico Scholcover: Was that in the procedures and I miss

906
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:51.540
Christopher Corral: No, I was talking

907
01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:56.610
Christopher Corral: With fatty, and he brought it up. I don't think we've been doing it didn't occur to me to do it because

908
01:53:57.690 --> 01:53:57.930
Federico Scholcover: Yeah.

909
01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:02.070
Federico Scholcover: So that should probably go in the training slides because we just throw them at the map halfway through.

910
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.110
Christopher Corral: Yeah, but it should be in the training slides and then just remind them once we bring it up. I guess the first time.

911
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:16.980
Federico Scholcover: So, optionally also thing I just learned. You can't hit stop share without saving the annotation or it goes away forever.

912
01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.860
Federico Scholcover: That's true. So don't don't do what I just did.

913
01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:22.920
Federico Scholcover: Take a screenshot then stop the screen share

914
01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.520
Christopher Corral: If you have the screenshot, you can just paste it. Right. Are you saying you didn't take the screenshot, you stop share first

915
01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:30.750
Federico Scholcover: I stopped the share first

916
01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:31.710
Christopher Corral: Oh, yeah, yeah.

917
01:54:32.010 --> 01:54:38.700
Federico Scholcover: Yeah. Lesson learned. Okay, I'm there. We're getting so many participant 21 we're getting so many lessons out of you. Thank you.

918
01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:41.970
Participant 21: The most problematic of all

919
01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:45.960
Federico Scholcover: No, no, no. Some of these things are on our end um

920
01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:54.210
Federico Scholcover: But so I think what we'll do is for the first mission before we give them control parsecs. We can just throw it on

921
01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:58.650
Federico Scholcover: Myself Minecraft. And then we hand over control. So that sounds like a plan.

922
01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:00.390
Federico Scholcover: Yeah.

923
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.820
Federico Scholcover: Chris, how you feel about that and we

924
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.840
Christopher Corral: Have to repeat that. Sure. So, you know what, let me actually set it up.

925
01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.920
Federico Scholcover: And I'll show you what I what I'm thinking. And I think that'll make more sense.

926
01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:12.360
Federico Scholcover: Okay, that

927
01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:13.860
Sound good

928
01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.410
Christopher Corral: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

929
01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:18.300
Federico Scholcover: And sound like you have a choice. So

930
01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:21.390
Participant 21: Quick question. So what's

931
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:27.450
Participant 21: Up time I click the button once. Um, what's the timer. Okay, or it still messed up a little

932
01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.860
Federico Scholcover: It looks right to me.

933
01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:29.460
Okay.

934
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:33.810
Federico Scholcover: Did it look right to ever Rob I know you've been timing it by hand.

935
01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:42.420
Rob Hyland: Yeah, it's a little hard, because the you got to subtract out the incident commander, but it did seem off by less

936
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:47.580
Rob Hyland: So that's one of the things we want to do is just get a real hard time around that.

937
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:56.580
Federico Scholcover: Okay, just, Well, while we're talking. Is there a reason that you've been timing them by hand. This whole time I'm just curious.

938
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:58.560
Federico Scholcover: I mean, it makes it

939
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.270
Rob Hyland: Just to find bugs.

940
01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:10.080
Federico Scholcover: Okay, it's like yeah well when you did it for the first one, without even knowing that like the timer would break. I was just like,

941
01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.910
Rob Hyland: When I was there last week, but I thought I saw some weird timer stuff so

942
01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.280
Federico Scholcover: Oh, okay. You think

943
01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:27.420
Rob Hyland: There might be an issue. It's a whole new timer implementation so you know when whenever you change something that's a good thing to test

944
01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:45.120
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so here's what we're going to do. I am not sharing my screen. So what I'm actually going to do is, before I give you control right so let's pretend this is the first mission. I think what we're going to want to do and Chris, you should probably the show you here.

945
01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:48.000
Lixiao  Huang: Yes.

946
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:51.330
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so I think what we'll do is, before I even give him control.

947
01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:53.730
Federico Scholcover: I will have him in this space with the map open

948
01:56:54.870 --> 01:57:01.980
Federico Scholcover: Right. And so I'll say something like, you know, at a certain point the dynamic map will pop up. Do you see the big blue map in the top right corner.

949
01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:16.980
Federico Scholcover: Us. OK. And then, so we'll say something like, as you walk around there will be a yellow line marketing where you've already been and your characters avatar will be represented by a Red Cloud at the edge of the line.

950
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.160
Lixiao  Huang: Do you recall that during the condition training slides.

951
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:29.700
Lixiao  Huang: And there was two pictures and then shows the trace and also the dogs.

952
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.830
Lixiao  Huang: I said I didn't see it.

953
01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.740
Lixiao  Huang: Then, so I asked you to go back and I explain

954
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.120
Lixiao  Huang: So that's where

955
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:40.350
Lixiao  Huang: The first time when you show it. You need to explain their

956
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:53.820
Lixiao  Huang: For here. Um, can they go remind them. But this isn't just to remind them. The main content that should be explained the when they first appears

957
01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:55.740
Federico Scholcover: Okay.

958
01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.740
Lixiao  Huang: And the beer is sentences that

959
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.610
Lixiao  Huang: Fatty. Can you post it again to everyone.

960
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.900
Federico Scholcover: The sites.

961
01:58:04.590 --> 01:58:06.960
Lixiao  Huang: No, no. Do some wording on

962
01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:13.290
Fade Eadeh: The schedule ready. It's in the zoom chat. Now that we, that was one of the slides that I think

963
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:15.840
Lixiao  Huang: Yeah, so, um,

964
01:58:16.170 --> 01:58:16.500
anagha mudigonda: Any

965
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:19.020
Lixiao  Huang: Any cannot see the trust so I

966
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:21.210
Federico Scholcover: Can see it.

967
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.750
Federico Scholcover: I got it pulled up. I just can't see it when the participants using per sec

968
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:25.800
Fade Eadeh: I see.

969
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:27.360
Federico Scholcover: Well, I can

970
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:35.130
Fade Eadeh: So that should be Brett, that should be read every time that the map appears so not just the first time, but every all three times.

971
01:58:35.610 --> 01:58:36.540
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so at the

972
01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:38.850
Lixiao  Huang: Point in into 2.5

973
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:47.460
Fade Eadeh: Yeah, yeah. So each of the three nations, just as a reminder is there might be forgetting between the missions what everything means

974
01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.530
Federico Scholcover: Okay, so

975
01:58:50.730 --> 01:58:54.270
Federico Scholcover: I gotta read that every single time. Got it. Yep, I'm

976
01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.690
Lixiao  Huang: Not you. I'm the narrator reads it.

977
01:58:57.990 --> 01:59:00.600
Federico Scholcover: Perfect less work for me more work for Naga

978
01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:03.450
Fade Eadeh: Me.

979
01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.760
Federico Scholcover: On me though. Thank you.

980
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:10.140
Federico Scholcover: Um, OK, but so do we want to show them the map during the start room or no.

981
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:16.080
Federico Scholcover: Is there any out since since we since Naga is going to say that at the seven and a half minute mark.

982
01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:27.930
Fade Eadeh: I don't think so. As the person that wants the map. I don't think we want to show and then have it disappeared and then show it again just show it later on. And I think those instructions should hopefully help

983
01:59:28.590 --> 01:59:28.950
Okay.

984
01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:33.060
Federico Scholcover: Can I throw a hand grenade into this conversation.

985
01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:40.350
Federico Scholcover: Yeah. Yes. Okay. So one of the reasons that and I can already tell someone's

986
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:41.640
Federico Scholcover: gonna hate me for saying this.

987
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:50.550
Federico Scholcover: That we paused for the incident commander queries or that we didn't want to like pull the participants attention away while they were engaged in the task.

988
01:59:53.190 --> 02:00:01.320
Federico Scholcover: Would there be echoes of that conversation when we at the two and a half minute mark go hey, here's the real time map.

989
02:00:04.110 --> 02:00:18.000
Fade Eadeh: Yeah, I think it's a fair point. The downside is that some people are not going to remember what all components of the map are so that cost benefit. It seems like the car. The benefit outweighs the cost, although I recognize that's going to be an issue.

990
02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:24.540
Federico Scholcover: Yeah. Hold on, let me go through to report. Let me pull the slides back up. I want to see means

991
02:00:24.690 --> 02:00:31.800
Lixiao  Huang: That means this statement will be repeated the four times during the slides you say it once.

992
02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:41.880
Lixiao  Huang: And then you, you asked before every minute 2.5 you want to say it again. So the same statement will appear four times in the whole experiment.

993
02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:49.830
Fade Eadeh: Um, no, no, no. So there's there's three sets of slides, I'm a man. I'm still mute or unmute

994
02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:51.390
Fade Eadeh: So I can hear you. Okay, good.

995
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:59.340
Fade Eadeh: So that there should be two slides in the training mission, there's a there's two pictures slides basically that show different parts of the map.

996
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:13.680
Fade Eadeh: The, the part that's verbally spoken will only be spoken during the math based intervention when it's appearing during the mission. So it should only be three times where the narrator is actually narrating

997
02:01:15.090 --> 02:01:17.790
Lixiao  Huang: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I agree. I'm

998
02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:24.810
Lixiao  Huang: I addressed to my wording, it's introduced four times the first time on the

999
02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:25.470
Lixiao  Huang: Site.

1000
02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:28.470
Lixiao  Huang: And three times of verbally by the narrator

1001
02:01:28.710 --> 02:01:29.700
Fade Eadeh: That's correct, yes.

1002
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:33.870
Federico Scholcover: Okay, um,

1003
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.850
Federico Scholcover: I don't want to open up a candle. Okay.

1004
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:48.780
Federico Scholcover: Since they're already technically being trained on the map itself. Right.

1005
02:01:50.730 --> 02:01:56.250
Federico Scholcover: Can you walk me. I guess the utility and saying, like, what the map does, right, the latter half of the statement.

1006
02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.420
Federico Scholcover: Is just to remind them correct

1007
02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:02.520
Federico Scholcover: Is that

1008
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:15.090
Fade Eadeh: Yes, yes. That's exactly right. So, because that this map intervention was presented you know 30 minutes ago, or however long it was Rowan's person was being trained so it seems reasonable to

1009
02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:17.580
Fade Eadeh: Remind them of the parameters that are important.

1010
02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:20.850
Federico Scholcover: Your kid. I forget who I am. Sometimes, so I get it.

1011
02:02:23.130 --> 02:02:24.390
Federico Scholcover: Okay, um,

1012
02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.090
Federico Scholcover: Are we ready to go.

1013
02:02:33.150 --> 02:02:42.000
Federico Scholcover: And, you know, we're ready yeah okay and participate 21 is a heads up. I did done goof pretty bad and I forgot to mark down your annotations.

1014
02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.160
Federico Scholcover: Uh huh. Oh, it's not there.

1015
02:02:44.370 --> 02:02:44.880
Federico Scholcover: You will

1016
02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:47.400
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead and read me on Slack, please.

1017
02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.470
Participant 21: Would you want me to redo the annotation.

1018
02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:55.140
Federico Scholcover: Do you want to use your annotations. Sure.

1019
02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.490
Participant 21: Sure, it doesn't matter to me.

1020
02:02:57.210 --> 02:03:01.320
Federico Scholcover: Okay, uh, what's the procedure for the experiment. If I go like this in the future.

1021
02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:04.890
Lixiao  Huang: Please do. So he has a reference during the mission.

1022
02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:08.550
Federico Scholcover: Okay. Sounds good. Yeah, go ahead and just annotate all over that.

1023
02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:10.650
Federico Scholcover: Will make it bigger.

1024
02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:12.660
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, there you go.

1025
02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.270
anagha mudigonda: Thank you want to add a time. Oh.

1026
02:03:24.150 --> 02:03:25.590
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, okay.

1027
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:39.180
Participant 21: And I'll be honest and say I'm I'm doing my annotations under the assumption that building layouts exactly the same.

1028
02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:47.910
Federico Scholcover: So if they say that, can we intervene and tell them it's not or to not make that assumption. Let me rephrase it to not make that assumption.

1029
02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:55.440
Christopher Corral: I i'm in favor of not letting them know at all that it's changing because right

1030
02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:00.900
Federico Scholcover: So it's telling him not to make that assumption inherently saying it's changing

1031
02:04:06.810 --> 02:04:09.330
Federico Scholcover: What if I just say it could be the same. It could be different. We don't know.

1032
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.000
Federico Scholcover: How do you feel about that.

1033
02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.750
Participant 21: Now that will create some ambiguity, which which will be good.

1034
02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:22.290
Federico Scholcover: Or do we write because him, assuming that it's the same as just as bad.

1035
02:04:23.490 --> 02:04:24.630
Federico Scholcover: As him, assuming it will be different.

1036
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:29.160
Federico Scholcover: Michelle, are you gonna say something, I interrupted you.

1037
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:33.030
Lixiao  Huang: I said, I may be different.

1038
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:38.250
Lixiao  Huang: So the, the blank.

1039
02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:46.530
Lixiao  Huang: Map is the same building structure before it clap before its collapse.

1040
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:55.500
Lixiao  Huang: But the actual building will be presented differently depending on the level of collapse.

1041
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:03.030
Federico Scholcover: Right. I think what I'm asking is What is that what you want us to tell the participant on

1042
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:06.330
Lixiao  Huang: Yeah.

1043
02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:07.710
Okay.

1044
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:13.830
Lixiao  Huang: Oh, let me get rid of. We don't, we don't need to say that, but if they asks

1045
02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:18.780
Lixiao  Huang: We always tell them the common knowledge is

1046
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:24.420
Lixiao  Huang: This blank map is the building structure before its collapse.

1047
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:29.670
Lixiao  Huang: And the actual collapse may vary every time.

1048
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.900
Okay.

1049
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.180
Federico Scholcover: So, okay.

1050
02:05:34.410 --> 02:05:36.120
Federico Scholcover: I think that's okay. Cool.

1051
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:49.110
Federico Scholcover: Thank you, Michelle. I appreciate that. Um, alright, participatory one. Can you go ahead and reconnect to me. Uh, let's go ahead and restart parsecs. So we avoid the whole kerfuffle from last time.

1052
02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:52.620
Federico Scholcover: For me is clicked,

1053
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:57.990
Federico Scholcover: And you know what's nice is we're basically at the two and a half hour mark.

1054
02:05:59.970 --> 02:06:01.260
Federico Scholcover: Go ahead and reconnect whenever you're ready.

1055
02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:12.240
Federico Scholcover: Okay, you should have controlled my mouse and keyboard.

1056
02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:12.900
Yeah.

1057
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:26.610
Lixiao  Huang: Is it possible that you only reconnect. A parsecs when there is technical issues when the is not then you just continue

1058
02:06:27.330 --> 02:06:33.180
Federico Scholcover: Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too. I just think it was happening every time. So it might just not be

1059
02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:37.830
Participant 21: The one. What does she mean I'm really I reconnected when there's technical issues.

1060
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:45.540
Federico Scholcover: So, oh so you shall there's some stuff that I have to kick them out of our sector do in the background.

1061
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:56.490
Federico Scholcover: Because when he's catch it apart to my computer on par sec. You can see my screen. And there are things that I'm doing in the background that I don't want him to see specifically when I'm setting up the map intervention.

1062
02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:58.410
Federico Scholcover: So,

1063
02:06:58.950 --> 02:07:01.920
Federico Scholcover: Only concern for condition for so I have to kick them out.

1064
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:05.730
Federico Scholcover: Are you, are you wondering like, is it worth it for me to

1065
02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:24.990
Lixiao  Huang: Say in the past pilot testing we had with Chris's computer this never happened. So this per second problem only happened once. So what why his computer doesn't have any problem when he kicked people out and but here you try to avoid any potential issue by

1066
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:35.490
Lixiao  Huang: You have to like every time when you when you add the person back, you need to move to the person or prospect that sounds like a seems an additional step.

1067
02:07:36.930 --> 02:07:42.990
Federico Scholcover: So what was happening was, we tried for a few times where I didn't restart, but only the participant had restarted.

1068
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:55.050
Federico Scholcover: And that wasn't working. So it seems like it's a two way issue where I also have to restart per sec and in the act of restarting par SEC the volume mixer decides that it's a completely new instance

1069
02:07:56.670 --> 02:07:59.580
Federico Scholcover: Which is why you keep hearing a pain in the butt scratchy sound.

1070
02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:05.160
Lixiao  Huang: Would you need to do this to all these events or just Aaron.

1071
02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:19.920
Federico Scholcover: I think it's only purchase. So if the running theory that the reason that he keeps losing control is because he's using a Mac, if that is why this is happening, then it was just this participant.

1072
02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.770
Federico Scholcover: And any participant that has a Mac.

1073
02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.290
Lixiao  Huang: Okay.

1074
02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:30.300
Federico Scholcover: That's, that's, that's the running theory. So

1075
02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:35.580
Lixiao  Huang: You can try it next time, see if this happens again.

1076
02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:47.250
Participant 21: I guess her question is primarily do we do you need to mute me on the which I think we have to write, or else if we don't you know the mixer to be the echo. Yeah.

1077
02:08:47.730 --> 02:08:48.150
Exactly.

1078
02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:54.360
Lixiao  Huang: I just didn't see Kristen mute like a people every time when they meet

1079
02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:03.240
Federico Scholcover: Right, because he. Yeah. No, he wasn't. It's just a symptom of the fact that this participants. The first one to use a Mac, to my knowledge.

1080
02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:04.740
Okay.

1081
02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:11.760
Participant 21: Chris did not need anyone prior to reconnecting then does he not get the ECHO.

1082
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:18.300
Federico Scholcover: So Chris was only connecting to them the first time and he's only getting he was only getting the echo ones.

1083
02:09:18.570 --> 02:09:24.990
Participant 21: That he muted ones and then that's it. You got it. Because for you. You have to keep restarting our site. And that's why

1084
02:09:25.170 --> 02:09:26.340
Federico Scholcover: I have to remediate every time.

1085
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:27.960
Participant 21: Got it. Yep.

1086
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:32.460
Federico Scholcover: Thank you. Yeah, of course. Alright, are we ready

1087
02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:34.680
Participant 21: But give me a short second, let me blow my nose.

1088
02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:35.580
Okay.

1089
02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:39.090
Federico Scholcover: Having a good day while we wait

1090
02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:43.560
Rob Hyland: It's llama. Terrific.

1091
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:49.170
Federico Scholcover: Yeah, I've never heard that before. Wait, that's not a reference to win and visit

1092
02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:51.660
Rob Hyland: It could be

1093
02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:53.610
Federico Scholcover: Okay, it's like

1094
02:09:54.930 --> 02:09:56.280
Rob Hyland: Avatar is a llama right now.

1095
02:09:56.850 --> 02:09:59.310
Federico Scholcover: I can't see it because I'm sharing my screen I'm sad now.

1096
02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.230
Christopher Corral: It's an adorable llama Friday, you're missing.

1097
02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:03.300
Fade Eadeh: It is really nice.

1098
02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.210
Federico Scholcover: I really feel like I'm missing out. And you guys are making me

1099
02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.520
Fade Eadeh: Yeah, a lot of foam. Oh, here.

1100
02:10:08.850 --> 02:10:09.630
Yeah.

1101
02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:11.790
Participant 21: I am ready.

1102
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:14.100
Fade Eadeh: Ready. Just a really quick thing.

1103
02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:17.400
Fade Eadeh: With parsecs. Sometimes what I do is I discount

1104
02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:28.410
Fade Eadeh: Instead of disconnecting the participant or the, the user the other person I remove them from my friends list and add them back on and oftentimes that also fixes the issue.

1105
02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:41.160
Fade Eadeh: So instead of everybody removed being removed or removing the restarting the pure try that out at some point. I also have a Mac myself so I'm happy to the test subject as needed.

1106
02:10:41.490 --> 02:10:42.450
Federico Scholcover: To Carrie Carrie.

1107
02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.270
Participant 21: And I are something if I could connect to Chris computer or somebody else's computer. We'll see if this is

1108
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:53.040
Participant 21: Just and Federico or, you know, who tried to triangulate the problem, whether it's

1109
02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.890
Participant 21: Really, maybe you know this something. Yeah.

1110
02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.420
Federico Scholcover: Okay, um,

1111
02:10:57.630 --> 02:11:01.830
Federico Scholcover: Do you have to read them as a friend, every time, though, right, instead of restarting fatty

1112
02:11:03.150 --> 02:11:12.960
Fade Eadeh: It's only in situations where you're having problems with the the mouse and the keyboard. That was one of the ways that I had fixed it, but it seems like restarting for both computers also works.

1113
02:11:14.490 --> 02:11:20.370
Fade Eadeh: Although I can imagine you wouldn't you wouldn't have the issues with the, the, the sound echoing problem.

1114
02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:21.720
Fade Eadeh: If I could you dealt with.

1115
02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:22.350
Yeah.

1116
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:26.700
Federico Scholcover: Which is probably better so

1117
02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.370
Federico Scholcover: We'll go. We'll probably go with that. Then

1118
02:11:31.110 --> 02:11:31.470
Federico Scholcover: I'm

1119
02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:35.430
Federico Scholcover: Cool. Everyone ready ready

1120
02:11:36.630 --> 02:11:37.170
Federico Scholcover: Are you ready

1121
02:11:37.530 --> 02:11:43.410
Federico Scholcover: Yes. Alright. Participant 21 whenever you're ready, go ahead, press that back to gain button.

1122
02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:45.270
Participant 21: In mind on your computer.

1123
02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:46.140
Federico Scholcover: You should be

1124
02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:51.990
Federico Scholcover: Press back to game button and press that button once

1125
02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:56.310
Federico Scholcover: You have to get there you go.

1126
02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:08.310
anagha mudigonda: Please describe which type of the video. Save. Next, yellow, green, or whoever comes first.

1127
02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:12.990
anagha mudigonda: Can you please describe why

1128
02:13:13.470 --> 02:13:30.240
Participant 21: Because yellow victims, would I invite means green will not die in five minutes. Also yellow carries Ohio which so this save all the yellows verse, then I will save the green ones I'm satisfied that I see most of the yellows.

1129
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:36.840
anagha mudigonda: Searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

1130
02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:48.150
Participant 21: Without searching for any information or can I use the man on the right, it doesn't have my tree. So it's not moving map, though. But if I look at the map on the right. I think I'm in the

1131
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:53.790
Participant 21: Middle believe I am in the conference room.

1132
02:13:55.650 --> 02:14:02.280
Participant 21: No, okay. No, I'm not familiar with conference room is through the men's room. So, no, I'm not very familiar where I am in the building.

1133
02:14:05.310 --> 02:14:05.640
anagha mudigonda: So,

1134
02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:09.750
Participant 21: Northern the northern part of building

1135
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:21.090
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with seven being extremely confident. How confident are you that you will rescue all the remaining yellow victims before the guy.

1136
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:30.930
Participant 21: Because based on the previous two trials. I wasn't able to save all the elements so

1137
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:37.920
Participant 21: Yeah, I'll put five because I'm not sure if the third that terrain has changed or anything at this time.

1138
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:48.120
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven be extremely anxious, how I feel about your performance so far in this mission.

1139
02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:53.940
Participant 21: Because once again I'm not, I'm not sure how much that arena has changed.

1140
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:56.400
Participant 21: So I'm not sure.

1141
02:14:57.690 --> 02:15:07.500
Participant 21: If the mental map that I have corresponds to one of the building corresponds to what their buildings actually out this so it's about five

1142
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:14.460
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with 10 being extremely how

1143
02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:19.710
anagha mudigonda: How would you rate your current level of effort in completing this machine.

1144
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:29.430
Participant 21: Six, because I do desperately on this tried to save all the yellow victims and hopefully I could beat my previous points. So six

1145
02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:31.560
anagha mudigonda: Please impossible.

1146
02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.790
Participant 21: So when when the moving back come up again. I think last time.

1147
02:16:06.690 --> 02:16:08.850
Federico Scholcover: It was traffic from point. Okay.

1148
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:15.300
Participant 21: So okay, so the layout did actually change. Okay.

1149
02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:18.720
Participant 21: So I was correct. I was in the conference room.

1150
02:17:05.490 --> 02:17:18.990
Federico Scholcover: Hey participant 21. Here's a real time map of your search in the top right corner of the Minecraft game, it shows where you are, which is the red circle where you've been, those yellow tiles and it's can continue to track your movement throughout the mission.

1151
02:18:06.330 --> 02:18:06.870
Participant 21: Once again,

1152
02:18:07.890 --> 02:18:14.190
anagha mudigonda: Please describe which type of system. The new same next yellow green or whoever comes first.

1153
02:18:15.450 --> 02:18:18.120
Participant 21: I will still save the yellows.

1154
02:18:18.810 --> 02:18:35.340
Participant 21: Because because my step 1,000,036 I'm assuming a timer 630 right there is. Yeah. So I serve sometimes save the yellow. So I'll try to say the yellows first and once that once the audit, then I will save the greens.

1155
02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:42.240
anagha mudigonda: Without searching for any information with you. Would you describe where you are in the building.

1156
02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:48.930
Participant 21: I believe I am where I started from. So probably the entrance entrance area ish

1157
02:18:50.610 --> 02:19:00.360
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven with one being extremely confident. How confident are you that you will let you all the remaining yellow victims before they died.

1158
02:19:02.130 --> 02:19:05.880
Participant 21: For because I

1159
02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:27.300
Participant 21: Actually look at my earrings. Pretty good. Okay, I'll put it around five because based on the moving map. It looks like I may have covered more area than I thought. And I, I, yeah, I hope I'll do my best to save the yellows are now.

1160
02:19:28.050 --> 02:19:36.390
anagha mudigonda: I have a scale of one to seven seven being extremely anxious how anxious to feel about your performance so far in the current situation.

1161
02:19:38.970 --> 02:19:48.300
Participant 21: For because based on the map. It looks like I covered more areas. And I thought, so I may be able to do a better do better this wrong than previously.

1162
02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:58.020
anagha mudigonda: Skin between one to seven seven being extremely high. How would you rate your current level of effort in completing this mission.

1163
02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:14.160
Participant 21: Five because there's less less obstructions lesser so it's not like the previous one, whereas into literally, literally cross through the men's bathroom so its lesser lesser effort because it meant more straightforward.

1164
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:52.980
Participant 21: Again,

1165
02:22:55.230 --> 02:23:01.320
anagha mudigonda: Please describe which type of wisdom can you say next yellow or whoever comes first.

1166
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:04.740
Participant 21: Green because all the yellows are already at this point.

1167
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:10.380
anagha mudigonda: Searching for any information would you describe where you are in the building.

1168
02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:17.580
Participant 21: I believe in the south and one of the cubicles. One of the office room typical type things.

1169
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:28.170
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven being extremely confident. How confident are you that you will rescue all the remaining green victims before the guide.

1170
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:31.830
Participant 21: For because

1171
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:35.460
Participant 21: I have four minutes left and

1172
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:42.300
Participant 21: I will do my best. But I think it will be about four not confident I would save all of them.

1173
02:23:43.890 --> 02:23:52.260
anagha mudigonda: On a scale of one to seven seven being extremely anxious how anxious, do you feel about your performance so far in the current mission.

1174
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:59.100
Participant 21: Five because at least I know there was one yellow victim that died so

1175
02:24:01.050 --> 02:24:10.980
anagha mudigonda: Let's begin between one to seven seven being extremely high. How would you rate your current level of effort in completing this mission six because

1176
02:24:11.250 --> 02:24:19.560
Participant 21: Although I thought this members slightly more straightforward. There was still. I mean, they're still obstructions and a little bit of challenge. So put six

1177
02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:46.410
anagha mudigonda: Right, you have completed the third mission. Please pull up the survey and complete the rest of the survey, please take your time to answer all the questions very please stop the resume recording and psycho. Bye.
