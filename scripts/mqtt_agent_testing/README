type "make" to run the tests.


This directory contains test scripts for each of the topics subscribed to
on the Message Bus.  The test output is the diff of what is the Agent is 
expected to produce for the given metadata input file, and what is actually
received on the Message Bus.  

There should be no differences except timestamps and possibly Agent version numbers
