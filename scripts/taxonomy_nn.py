"""
This script creates a file named 'taxonomy_map.json' which contains a mapping
between the labels produced by ODIN and the concepts in the Planning group's
taxonomy.

It creates this mapping by comparing the cosine angle between vector 
representations of the elements in different taxonomies. The vector
representations are created by averaging the token embeddings of all the words
comprising each taxonomy element.

The final map file is a json containing a list a of all the term mappings. 
Each element in the ODIN taxonomy is mapped to the 5 most similar elements 
in the Planning group taxonomy. The relative angles are also stored so other
systems can perform noisy matching.


Arguments:
 1) ODIN taxonomy which contains all labels to be used in yaml format
 2) Planning group taxonomy which contains variables they want to align
    to labels produced by ODIN system.
 3) Path to token embeddings. These embeddings will be used by the script
    to estimate the similarity between items in the two taxonomies.
