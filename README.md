# tomcat-text

This repository contains natural language text processing code for the DARPA
Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program. See the
main ToMCAT project page for more information: https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat.


# Web App

The repo includes a webapp you can use to debug ODIN rules. When you input a
piece of text, it will run the text through the system and visually display any
mentions extracted by the system. The app will reload if it detects any changes
to the rule files, so you can easily jump back and forth between writing rules
and testing them. It also includes a syntax parse and specifies which rule
generated each mention. 

To open the webapp run the following command from the top level directory:
```
sbt webapp/run
```
Then navigate to the specified port using your web browser.



# Dialog Agent

The repo also includes a Dialog Agent application that will ingest text and
output extracted events of interest for a particular domain.  Sources of Dialog
Agent input text are files, the MQTT message bus, and interactively from a
terminal.

In all cases, a final optional argument of "-m n" can be used to control the
number of taxonomy matches in extractions, where n can range from 0 to 5, and
defaults to 0.



### Stdin mode

```
  sbt "runMain org.clulab.asist.RunDialogAgent stdin"
```

In this mode, the Dialog Agent will prompt the user for text, and return the
extractions directly.  


An example of the agent running in stdin mode, with the number of taxonomy
matches at the default setting of zero

> I see a green victim!
{"label":"Self","span":"I","arguments":{},"start_offset":0,"end_offset":1,"taxonomy_matches":[]}
{"label":"Victim","span":"victim","arguments":{},"start_offset":14,"end_offset":20,"taxonomy_matches":[]}

> There is rubble here.
{"label":"Rubble","span":"rubble","arguments":{},"start_offset":9,"end_offset":15,"taxonomy_matches":[]}
{"label":"Deictic","span":"here","arguments":{},"start_offset":16,"end_offset":20,"taxonomy_matches":[]}

>

```


To exit the program, press [CTRL+D].  It will take several seconds for sbt to
gracefully shut down the agent.


### File mode

To run the Dialog Agent with files, the user specifies the input and output
filenames, and optionally the number of taxonomy matches to return.  

```
  sbt "runMain org.clulab.asist.RunDialogAgent file inputfile outputfile"
```

Supported input file types are WebVtt(.vtt), and TomCAT metadata (.metadata).
A directory can be specified as input.  Directories are traversed one level
deep, and only the .vtt and .metadata files are processed.  Input files are
processed in alphabetical order.

The ouput from the file(s) written to a singe output file in the order of
processing.  
   

### MQTT mode

To run the Dialog Agent on the MQTT Message Bus, specify the mqtt run mode,
then the host and port that the MQTT message broker is running on.

```
  sbt "runMain org.clulab.asist.RunDialogAgent mqtt hostname port"
```


### Reprocessing 

The Dialog Agent can reprocess metadata that it has already produced.  The new output
will be identical except for the data.extractions field, which will be
replaced with extractions created with the latest Dialog Agent rules.


```
  sbt "runMain org.clulab.asist.RunDialogAgent reprocess inputDirectory outputDirectory"
```

## Metadata Input

Metadata read by the Dialog Agent, either from .metadata files or the Message
Bus, are expected to include the following JSON fields.  Extra structures and
fields are ignored.  Missing data are replaced with null values in the output
JSON.


#### Chat 

```
{
  "topic": "minecraft/chat",
  "msg": {
    "experiment_id": string,
    "trial_id": string,
    "replay_root_id": string,
    "replay_id": string
  },
  "data": {
    "sender": string,
    "text": string
  }
}
```  

#### UAZ ASR

```
{
  "topic": "agent/asr/final",
  "msg": {
    "experiment_id": string,
    "trial_id": string,
    "replay_root_id": string,
    "replay_id": string
  },
  "data": {
    "participant_id": string,
    "id": string,
    "text": string
  }
}
```

#### Aptima ASR

```
{
  "topic": "status/asistdataingester/userspeech",
  "msg": {
    "experiment_id": string,
    "trial_id": string,
    "replay_root_id": string,
    "replay_id": string
  },
  "data": {
    "playername": string,
    "text": string
  }
}
```

When using the Message Bus, it is not necessary to include a "topic" JSON
element.


## Output 

The Dialog Agent will publish its analysis to the message bus in Chat Analysis
Message JSON format.
