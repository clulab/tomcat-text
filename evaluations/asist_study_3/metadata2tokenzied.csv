sweetheart logging back in,['0'],[0]
yep that's the back at work this time,['0'],[0]
yeah I just like starting at the left side Maybe,['0'],[0]
yeah I bet it probably got B probably just telling you know or eggs yeah I'm the medic on it would probably be best to do it in some kind of predetermined way so we all know,['Medic'],[6]
yeah hmm yes I guess have transporter was to go ahead and scout out but rooms have people in it that I can die on you if engineer wants to go and figure out which room is have Rubble in it and I'll just kind of follow along and do whatever room cure whatever room for whatever as I can,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Rubble', 'Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 20, 4, 20, 7, 5, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
and I'll label all the people or whatever that B2 B Prince hoarded,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
and then so I guess and then C so,"['Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[11, 11, 11]"
yeah engineer will just suggest and then once we know what rooms have like threats in them or whatever we'll all like go to it so then I can cure the people and then we can get them out and then the engineer can make sure that the stuff can be clear door whatever,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 20, 20, 20, 4, 4, 20, 20, 20]"

okay,['0'],[0]
okay can you make sure you mark it,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay I need one other person to help me cure and A2 the critical person okay I guess I got the medic,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[3, 1, 19, 6, 2]"
can you transport that at C,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
there's two and A2 or an A to severe A1 so I'll take one,"['Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 3, 20, 13]"
all right um so I guess this is medic F3 as for if you want to get that last person in A1 and then engineer all come down to,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation', 'RescueInteractions', 'Victim']","[3, 4, 3, 6, 11, 14, 12, 2]"
yeah A4 and so all I just need you that are you in A4 already okay so I'll just I'll need to next to me so I can hear the critical,"['Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[3, 3, 1, 20, 20]"
I'll try this one first,['Plan'],[20]
hey,['0'],[0]
and then this one,['Precedence'],[11]
okay do you want to take since you're slower C is closer so you want to take the C1 I'll take the A1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 3, 20, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
and then you can get us out oh I could do your thing to the transporter here person so that because I faster,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[20, 11, 5, 2]"

all right this is medic we meet back at the place where there's a bunch of tub what was that C4 where those bunch of people,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
okay,['0'],[0]
the transport you want to take this person and then engineer do what I,"['Engineer', 'Precedence', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[4, 11, 5, 2]"
this is back door die come to the room Green in there I don't even go there a c C2 this room has a critical,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Move']","[3, 1, 13, 10, 10]"
and I blocked,['0'],[0]
pass is wrong room open I'm sorry,['0'],[0]
sorry about that that was C3 there back here,['Room'],[3]
yeah you broke this,['0'],[0]
I'm here this one,['0'],[0]
and then,['Precedence'],[11]
I guess I got to take that all I'll say I'll take the this one is type B so I'll take it since it's closer,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 20, 2]"
die when I think I'd no one in there,['Victim'],[2]
engineer we need you at C3 or C2,"['Room', 'Room', 'Engineer']","[3, 3, 4]"
okay everybody out of there correct,['0'],[0]
all right okay let's go down to is that b a door up to the top,"['Instruction', 'Move']","[19, 10]"
just B tool it has two people and I can't C though it's covered up by the okay and it has the hazard okay,['0'],[0]
so the safe one is type A,['Victim'],[2]
I can't really put a marker down because it's not a space type Ace the farthest away so if transport if you want to take that one,"['MarkerBlock', 'Transporter']","[8, 5]"
we're at B8 okay I just saw you pass by here and there there's a critical C1 and I'm sorry in A1 that one of those an a,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 3, 3, 1, 13]"
I was right and C that there's a stone a closer to that,['0'],[0]
okay the C down here is covering gravel I'm just going to go to the the South C,['Rubble'],[7]
yeah I'm just going to go to the North Sea,['0'],[0]
are they both covered,['0'],[0]
okay both c yeah both seas are covered,['0'],[0]
all right we should probably all meet back and start working on like the middle section,['0'],[0]
yeah don't go Scout ahead I need to drop off this victim and then this is the medic engineer can you broke in through this gravel or here thank you,"['Victim', 'YesNoQuestion', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Rubble']","[2, 18, 4, 6, 10, 11, 11, 7]"
okay,['0'],[0]
so all right C E5 and D2 just go check out D2 really good,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Search']","[3, 3, 3, 15]"
there are two victims in in where they found that says in D1 type,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2]"
B and type A,['Victim'],[2]
I'll be right there I was just,['Move'],[10]
I registered a critical position is are you by E3,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room']","[1, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
and then do we need any clear any Rubble or roast E3 okay,"['Room', 'Precedence', 'Rubble', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 11, 7, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
C,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
and I C oh,['0'],[0]
I can transport you want to take that safe one back that's already out here,['Plan'],[20]
engineer can you help me broke through this C Zone the north won,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'HelpRequest', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 19, 16, 18]"
so should we move on to the right side then,"['Precedence', 'YesNoQuestion']","[11, 18]"
mmm because it looks like a lot of these are pretty close,['Search'],[15]
I took the critical but the one with the other critical inside B where a nice Sunset E5,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room']","[1, 3]"
this is the medic transporter where are you,"['Question', 'Medic', 'Transporter']","[17, 6, 5]"
okay K2 icon down is help Scout all these rooms,['Room'],[3]
and here it looks like you're in one of the hazard ones or whatever,['Search'],[15]
critical in door window K2 want to break the in,['Room'],[3]
enter normal ones have type B so,"['Move', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[10, 13, 2, 2]"
I put it outside,['0'],[0]
okay okay yeah I'm going to take the B and then transport it to you want to scout out somewhere,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
let's move over to the else the blue ones Alan them and also those caves and then engineer our this is medic going to come over today okay,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Medic', 'Precedence']","[4, 19, 6, 11]"
I think he is engineer I need you in L1,"['Engineer', 'Room']","[4, 3]"
pass up the wrong thing shoot,['0'],[0]
this is a type B,['Victim'],[2]
this is an A and the other one of those a type B,['Victim'],[2]
okay,['0'],[0]
pass it there is it looks like okay engineer do not break me into where you are right now and then,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Precedence', 'Search']","[4, 19, 11, 15]"
transport you to want to come because there's a critical condition one you might want to pick up an a normal,"['CriticalVictim', 'Transporter']","[1, 5]"
that's critical and then this one is a,['Precedence'],[11]
I'll take this type A,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
and then you can take the critical one,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[1, 20, 11]"
enter,"['Move', 'Instruction']","[10, 19]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm gonna die this last one engineer I need your help and this and K4,"['Engineer', 'HelpRequest', 'Room']","[4, 16, 3]"
and then transport open icon here to all right right here just this one block that works,['Precedence'],[11]
okay that's on the type A,['Victim'],[2]
and then,['Precedence'],[11]
I was like 3 seconds away oh I died,['0'],[0]
this is the medic I'm finished the survey,['Medic'],[6]
systematic I'm back,['0'],[0]
okay this is the medic so I think do you want to try more of like a scouting type plan like b b do all the scouting initially,"['Medic', 'Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 20, 18]"
Amicus,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
mhm,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah always so I think this is the medic I think like it's saying like where the meetings are so I think that's probably where like people are more likely going to be so we probably would have prioritized checking those first,"['Medic', 'Meeting']","[6, 9]"
and then,['Precedence'],[11]
let's see I guess if you want our planet like a path it might be best to like start,['Plan'],[20]
it might actually be best to start in the middle and then work our way either left or right because the middle is where we spawn,"['Precedence', 'Precedence']","[11, 11]"
yeah like I said B1,['Room'],[3]
start with D4 and then,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
D4 C gets is because there's a meeting and D4 start with D4 then go over to is F4 in the same area,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Meeting', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 13, 9, 11]"
yeah the go over to F4 and G3,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
yeah mmm,['0'],[0]
Yeah I'm dead what actually this is the medic yeah I guess I'll talk about it no more walking me and the engineer can probably carry the victims outside of the places that have like Rubble inside them or dangers so then you can pick them up without having to go inside again,"['Victim', 'HelpRequest', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Rubble']","[2, 16, 20, 4, 20, 20, 6, 11, 7]"
all right so we can leave people in dangerous areas outside,['Plan'],[20]
okay engineer to enter so critical in here yeah,"['Engineer', 'Move']","[4, 10]"
all right if you want to carry that outside,['0'],[0]
and I guess yeah,['0'],[0]
okay and then,['Precedence'],[11]
did you check to check the F1 whatever,"['Room', 'Search', 'Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 15, 15, 18]"
okay this is where there is a,['0'],[0]
okay hold this one here,['0'],[0]
okay I found two,['0'],[0]
Thursday type A and type B,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
um,['0'],[0]
alright engineer to what I come over to the F2 F3 area okay,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'Room']","[4, 3, 3]"
and then this is the medic transporter I left I left two people in D2,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[3, 6, 11, 5]"
this critical up here,['0'],[0]
and I put a critical in the hallway,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
and then engineer you just follow me close I think there's another one up here,"['Engineer', 'Precedence']","[4, 11]"
other that sorry that's the one you know it's not okay so we got that b there's two critical Zone here speak out that one but,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
not one over here,['0'],[0]
okay all right yeah we're here so if the Index close,['0'],[0]
they're going to break that one,['0'],[0]
in case you want to grab engineer toilet trapped tool I grabbed the critical length in the hallway,"['HelpRequest', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer']","[16, 1, 4]"
okay here's the type A,['Victim'],[2]
that's a critical I think the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim']","[1, 1]"
another one you picked up is critical all right I'm Type A is right here,['Victim'],[2]
all right let's go off to the right engineer this is medic,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Medic']","[4, 19, 6]"
so i2a and M1 so looks like,['Room'],[3]
that is down here and,['0'],[0]
okay it's on the other side this one here,['0'],[0]
I am,['0'],[0]
I marked two more and J1 so they enter B they're labeled,"['Move', 'Room']","[10, 3]"
set a critical in here engineer button help me get through this,"['CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Instruction']","[1, 4, 19, 19]"
we're gonna destroy the label I'm sorry okay those are critical in this one and sight said there was,['0'],[0]
I'm just going to get it okay,['0'],[0]

oh that's weird it's okay,['0'],[0]
all right I'll take the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
this one engineer inside of,['Engineer'],[4]
inside of I3 okay right there is one in here,['Room'],[3]
don't take this critical outside,['Instruction'],[19]
hi this is medic gonna take those transporter,"['Medic', 'Transporter']","[6, 5]"
engineer are you close B I2 I2 A4,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 4, 3, 3, 14]"
okay do I take that type B outside,"['Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[2, 18]"
leave lots of others a couple in the hallway or try this is medic transport transport Tater take okay,"['Medic', 'Transporter', 'Transporter']","[6, 5, 5]"
looks like we got older we want to list it says medic engineer D1 a kind of thing over to the left side of the map so it looks like they have less stuff I've gotten so far over there and then transport area just get those last ones and then put a bit of silver in the left side,"['Room', 'Search', 'Transporter', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 15, 5, 4, 6, 11, 11, 11]"
yes it has GPS signal loss I think that's part of the thing okay I'm inside A1 it looks like there was nothing all right there is two in sight gear engineer if you want to help me grab one of them,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'ReportLocation', 'Search']","[3, 20, 4, 19, 13, 14, 15]"
die,['Instruction'],[19]
all right engineer the one you're grabbing is a Type A,"['Engineer', 'Victim']","[4, 2]"
but yeah this place is outside and label it,['0'],[0]
so we'll be leaving just the unlabeled ones outside all the doors okay all right that's a critical medic button here,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Medic']","[1, 20, 6]"
all right I'm going to click shoot,['Plan'],[20]
yeah this is medic engineer you want to take that's critical outside,"['Engineer', 'Medic']","[4, 6]"

all right and you have transporter out there's three criticals guys want to,"['CriticalVictim', 'Transporter']","[1, 5]"
all right transporter take that,"['Instruction', 'Transporter']","[19, 5]"
engineer takes out and since we have less this is medic things we don't have much time left let's just all take them down engineer if you want C here is C is the closest down to the South Zone C,"['Plan', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Medic']","[20, 4, 4, 6]"
and then yeah okay this is medic and clear if you want to help probably hand off here person too,"['Medic', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[6, 11, 2]"
and nice all right and I don't think we're going to get anywhere on time if i s,['0'],[0]
red para time yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah definitely during the second half we definitely improved a lot,['0'],[0]
I think during that the first half we were still like working on that new strategy but by the second half of sorry going like super quickly,['Plan'],[20]
this is the medic I'm done the survey,['Medic'],[6]
rejoining the server for an hour,['0'],[0]
I C,['0'],[0]
Block C,['0'],[0]
okay guys this is transporter just for our planning critical victims are probably going to be in the dangerous rooms so we're going to want to do those make sure that the we have the engineer with you when you're going in there,"['CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Move', 'ReportLocation', 'Transporter']","[1, 4, 10, 14, 5]"
yes,['0'],[0]
this is engineer so this would be a rooms are going to be i4a E5 and C4 there's nine in total but those are the really severe ones and I'll go through and just mark them starting with the most severe first,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Room', 'Engineer']","[3, 20, 3, 4]"
okay,['0'],[0]
and then medic what was your information,"['Medic', 'Precedence']","[6, 11]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I just have that critical victims are most likely to be in areas with the most severe damage so I will be putting down markers and calling out if I need someone to come help me save people,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Instruction', 'MarkerBlock']","[20, 1, 20, 19, 8]"
I also had a list of attendees for different like schedule so like I have like a management meeting and a lunch and a project meeting but I don't have any idea where those are,"['Question', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[17, 9, 9, 9]"
I have those and room numbers so I have like A2 is human resources B9 is zoom2 from Office E4 security training and then,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 9, 11]"
this is medic sorry,['Medic'],[6]
is this is this engineer or is this medic okay in that case I do have a list so storage reorganization and then the zoom meetings and zoom meeting from Office are all canceled,"['Engineer', 'Medic', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence']","[4, 6, 9, 9, 11]"
I don't know if you're seeing that,['Plan'],[20]
okay so that's E5 B9 and I2 are going to not have people then most likely,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 3, 3, 11, 14]"
it might be,['0'],[0]
okay this is good to be a bit of a clusterfuck holy shit um I guess here's we could start on this um so the management meeting where the management meeting the lunch in the project meeting which one of those is the closest to our start,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9, 9]"
M3 i4a and management project and most last when you said,['Room'],[3]
it's going to be management meeting project meeting and lunch,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
lunch so that's,['Meeting'],[9]
M3 has danger by the way Rubble,"['Room', 'Rubble']","[3, 7]"
M3 i4a and D2,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay if we want to start on i4a just to get some people moving,['Plan'],[20]
yeah i4a is the most severe I'll head over there with you guys,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
okay,['0'],[0]
all right sounds good,['0'],[0]
and then I'll just start working down this hallway when you guys start going through it yeah because there's loads of victims in here and then I'll work down here and then we can do as we go,"['Precedence', 'Victim', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[11, 2, 20, 20, 13, 20, 10, 11, 11, 11]"
i4a has Rubble we're going to need to wait for engineer,"['Engineer', 'Rubble']","[4, 7]"
so slow it's awesome,['0'],[0]
all right buddy,['0'],[0]
engineer can you come further in,"['Engineer', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 18]"

okay,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
okay I am setting a b up against the wall with the marker just because you are faster,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
unlucky,['0'],[0]

I'm going to start working on that middle Brown B for marking room for victims,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
this is the what's it called The Transporter,['Transporter'],[5]
sorry,['0'],[0]
our Pinky,['0'],[0]
when I put a victim down in there is no marker by it is C,"['MarkerBlock', 'Victim']","[8, 2]"

yep and there was also a critical victim he would so it works out,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
you then about 10 years,['Precedence'],[11]
map,['0'],[0]
I'm to verify engineer you are going to the SOS marker on the right side right,"['Engineer', 'MarkerBlock']","[4, 8]"
I thought he said A2 bad,['Room'],[3]

cool,['0'],[0]
clear,['0'],[0]
so since you're going to be engineer since you're heading to K2,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'Move']","[4, 3, 10]"
after that if you want to work on the bottom one I'm going to start putting the Seas outside of the bottom one,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
okay,['0'],[0]
and then you can just focus on clearing that,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
medic were you able to get out,['Medic'],[6]

I don't know why it didn't work right thank you,['0'],[0]
oh,['0'],[0]
I love a c,['0'],[0]
there we go and then you know kind of C1 was I think I said that,"['Room', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 10, 11, 11]"
K1 C let me put them down please,"['Instruction', 'Room']","[19, 3]"
i got them and then clear,"['Precedence', 'Precedence']","[11, 11]"
all right,['0'],[0]
there's a c outside of North Zone B,['0'],[0]
I'll get the C,['Plan'],[20]
well clear out north,['0'],[0]
Zone C,['0'],[0]
and then if you guys go to the the Far West Side there's quite a few critical Zone could be worked on,['Precedence'],[11]
alright um this is medic engineer in G3 there's some Rubble if you could clear that out I could get the person inside,"['Plan', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Medic', 'Rubble', 'RescueInteractions', 'Victim']","[20, 4, 3, 13, 6, 7, 12, 2]"
where was it sorry,['0'],[0]
G3,['Room'],[3]
yes,['0'],[0]
G3 and transporter do you want to come down the C aisle and help move some of the critical Zone,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 3, 5, 18]"
G3 is clear and there's two non critical Zone,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 13]"
I am currently stuck in C 2,['HelpRequest'],[16]
yeah,['0'],[0]
C2,['Room'],[3]
on the way home,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
in that case I'm going to start just working on marking more rooms as transporter,"['Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 5]"
die every time I turn throw me off,['0'],[0]
oh,['0'],[0]
maximum casualties,['0'],[0]
guys I'm starting to think we're not going to get everyone,['Plan'],[20]
yeah,['0'],[0]
in that case we should probably focus on the on picking up the critical it's just because they're worth like 5 times,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
okay,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
yeah I'm at C to let me go up to the one by C4 and then we can go down and do the two a one a two I need freedom,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 20, 10, 10, 11]"
and then there's more Rubble,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence', 'Rubble']","[13, 11, 7]"
awesome engineer if you want to yeah there's more Rubble in here,"['Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[4, 13, 7]"
and then we'll just need you to grab the door once this guy's healed,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
perfect I got the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
all right and then the other one is a type of B I will put him outside the door,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[20, 11, 2]"
awesome engineer you want to come and grab the door,"['Engineer', 'Move']","[4, 10]"
this way,['0'],[0]
red hair,['0'],[0]
oh my God,['0'],[0]
oh my gosh no it's just,['0'],[0]

medic the one you're holding is a b type right,"['Medic', 'Victim']","[6, 2]"
yep I put a marker by it,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
awesome,['0'],[0]
and then there's a critical and C4 if one of you guys can come with me,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Precedence']","[3, 1, 11]"
I got it,['0'],[0]
or engineer I got it,['Engineer'],[4]
got it,['0'],[0]
all right I'm gonna head down to a one and a two,['0'],[0]
I got them I got them,['0'],[0]
there's two normal ones not even worth except for seconds,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
yep got it,['0'],[0]
this is b b as in boy yeah that's unfortunate,['0'],[0]
well you know we got over half the critical Zone,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
yeah,['0'],[0]
engineer you glad to be faster,['Engineer'],[4]
yeah it's pretty nice,['0'],[0]
I was so slow and then just,['Precedence'],[11]
did I'm feeling so slow right now as the as the,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
guy,['0'],[0]
do playing it 5fps that's hurting,['Instruction'],[19]
I think we did great,['0'],[0]
yeah I mean we got over half the points,['0'],[0]
crank 90s on these casualties,['0'],[0]
red,['0'],[0]
okay thanks,['0'],[0]
this is transporter just finished the survey,['Transporter'],[5]
who's engineer and finished as well,['Engineer'],[4]
and this is medic I'm also done,['Medic'],[6]
other Red Door still there,['0'],[0]
transporter here I'm back,['Transporter'],[5]
this is medic I'm back,['Medic'],[6]
transport,['Transporter'],[5]
ready,['0'],[0]
this is medic should I got a message on slack through parsec should I open it,"['Medic', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 18, 18]"
okay I will not,['0'],[0]
no don't worry about it you're good,['0'],[0]
wait did you say transporter I'm back,"['Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[5, 18]"
sorry about that,['0'],[0]
yeah sorry,['0'],[0]
okay guys I'm thinking we should focus on the left side instead of the right side,['Plan'],[20]
oh sorry whoops all right,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay so we kind of got fucked on the doors last game so what I'm thinking what I'm thinking is if we focus on the left side I think there's going to be a lot more where it's just a single door with multiple victims in it,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 2]"
friend,['0'],[0]
yeah that's that's a good idea because I kept as medic I kept getting in situations where I was just kind of Trapped in a room and waiting for engineer to make the painful Trek across the map to come rescue me,"['HelpRequest', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'RescueInteractions']","[16, 4, 6, 12]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
exactly and then also,['Precedence'],[11]
okay,['0'],[0]
there's a lot of damage on the left side like we have one c a b d yeah there's like five damaged rooms in there and that's all in the left hand side so it'll be a good place to focus,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
do you have the,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
door room numbers for the damaged rooms,['0'],[0]
there was a meeting there so,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Meeting']","[13, 9]"
yeah so yeah so I can start off in A1 and then go up to b 2,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 20, 20, 11, 11]"
which meetings,['Meeting'],[9]
okay there's also a meeting there I have a list of Zoom meeting and Facilities meeting,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
okay well for this,['0'],[0]
okay because zoom2 meeting got canceled both of the zoom or Zoom meeting and zoom2,"['Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay so there is,['0'],[0]
clear ones we can just enter right we can just not even show up,"['Move', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[10, 20, 20]"
yeah so both A1 and A4 but B2 is facilities meeting,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 3, 9]"
hmm,['0'],[0]
your list me all of the meetings that were canceled today,['Meeting'],[9]
that'll be the storage reorganization the zoom meeting in the zoom2 from office,['Meeting'],[9]
okay and then does,['Precedence'],[11]
what was the other information because I have one two three four five six I have six rooms where were meetings were not cancelled where there was planned meetings and that is B2 B6 D4 F4 i2a and M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Plan', 'Question']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 20, 17]"
so for me the technical exchange the lunch and the management have the most attendees,['Meeting'],[9]
technical Exchange,['0'],[0]
all the room B is mention have known damaged by the way like B6 M1 into it,"['Room', 'Instruction', 'Room']","[3, 19, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay good to know,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
and I case yeah if we want to just start out doing the same strategy before here on the left side like leftmost and then just work back,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 11, 11]"
I'm going through and marking,['0'],[0]
make sure to look at B2 and B6 when you have the chance because I have a feeling there's going to be critical in there,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah especially B6 that one should be pretty happy,['Room'],[3]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah B2 is got critical in there,['Room'],[3]
yeah A1 have nothing,['Room'],[3]
make sure market with the,['0'],[0]
B6 is can be six is completely covered up by gravel engineer if you want to come up here and there's critical Zone there yep sorry,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Move', 'Rubble']","[3, 20, 4, 10, 7]"
make sure the market,['0'],[0]
I2 going to b 2,['Room'],[3]
yeah there's loads of critical Zone over here,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
awesome I'll start moving those,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
B6 is clear then we got A3 critical Zone B6 that's really a good place to start,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 11]"
yeah that probably the place to go,['0'],[0]
yeah this is medical someone join me in B6 of bacon,['Room'],[3]
yeah,['0'],[0]
alrighty,['0'],[0]
are all three of these critical,['0'],[0]
okay Roger that I'll start moving them,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yep L3,['Room'],[3]
engineer you close to A3 help me of the critical,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Instruction']","[3, 1, 4, 19]"
B3,['Room'],[3]
oh I am also trapped in A3 A's and Adam,"['Room', 'HelpRequest']","[3, 16]"
all right,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
all right there's a critical that way this way,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
I'm going to put,['Plan'],[20]
the no victim sign next to the C ones just so there's a marker next to them,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'MarkerBlock', 'Victim']","[1, 13, 8, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
it should be clear,['0'],[0]
another option you could do is since we don't need it right now do you want to put just like the SOS marker is down,"['MarkerBlock', 'YesNoQuestion']","[8, 18]"
yeah um can someone come with me to B2,"['Room', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 10, 18]"
I'll be back there in a sec,['Plan'],[20]
D2 yeah,['Room'],[3]
engineer is coming I'm good,['Engineer'],[4]
right here,['0'],[0]
okay and then yeah just the the SOS markers or something because,"['MarkerBlock', 'Precedence']","[8, 11]"
if my wish were walking past everything,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
then we don't end up mistaking it for thinking we already cleared that spot,['Precedence'],[11]
gotcha,['0'],[0]
do you want me to put that next to the ones that,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
armored A and B as well,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
no you don't need to just the just the critical ones,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
transporter was there another victim in b 1,['Transporter'],[5]
I don't believe so but I have zero confidence on that,['0'],[0]
okay because I went through earlier and I didn't see another one so I'm marking it clear for now,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I can do a quick run through here in a sec,['Plan'],[20]
clear out D4 it now,['Room'],[3]
awesome I'm double-checking B1,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
there is a critical and,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
critical and normal one and D4,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
and then that B1 is totally clear,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
transporter do you want to look at A4 as well when you have the chance we have F4 i2a and M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Search', 'Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 3, 3, 15, 5, 18]"
awesome I'll go and check F4 here next I'm just marking one last role of victim,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Room', 'Move', 'Search', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 3, 10, 15, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
A4 has Rubble I'll come back over that one,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Rubble']","[3, 20, 10, 7]"

all right,['0'],[0]
C here,['0'],[0]
correction there's two critical Zone here so this would be a great place to go,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
I am currently in D4 and I have a critical of someone could help me,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Instruction', 'ReportLocation']","[1, 3, 19, 14]"
trapped,['HelpRequest'],[16]
and I'm also trapped yep,['HelpRequest'],[16]

yeah,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
yeah our map is fucked,['0'],[0]
who who lost the GPS signal,['0'],[0]
that one this is a critical eye cannot see my map right now cool okay so,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
all right so G,['0'],[0]
e c,['0'],[0]
there's also a b make sure to come back for a transporter,['Transporter'],[5]
yep,['0'],[0]
99,['0'],[0]
and there was okay,['0'],[0]
I swear you'd think they'd give us but better GPS has,['0'],[0]
honestly,['0'],[0]
They seized budget,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
whereabouts did you all end up going,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
I have there is an a outside of the C room,['0'],[0]
C,['0'],[0]
I'm a red red,['0'],[0]
and I'm going to bring a b victim there shortly,"['Plan', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[20, 2, 2]"
I can grab that eggs,['Plan'],[20]
okay and then if y'all wanted then rotate into that big Center Brown room I can I know where that is to be able to meet y'all there,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 11, 18]"
all right,['0'],[0]
because you can double team there's at least two criticals in there,['Plan'],[20]
I'm an engineer I am trapped inside the place I was trapped before with the double doors transporter just walked past me,"['HelpRequest', 'HelpRequest', 'Engineer', 'Transporter']","[16, 16, 4, 5]"
why do you which one I see you guys,['0'],[0]
oh I see ya out by the the C entrance at the bottom and then right here,['Precedence'],[11]
he's coming,['0'],[0]
okay if you actually if you go this way this door this is where we need to be going,['Plan'],[20]
okay liebelei,['0'],[0]
into here around this way,['0'],[0]
there's going to be a door this way the engineer needs to break through,['Engineer'],[4]
alright right around the corner here,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
and then there's a critical there's a critical down this way to that they need broken into the I just got blocked in as well,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence']","[1, 1, 13, 13, 11]"
gotta love that,['0'],[0]
maps,['0'],[0]
okay I've put a c down,['0'],[0]
Roger that taken care of the C I'll be back in a minute,['0'],[0]
that's anyone back here,['0'],[0]
don't nothing back there,['0'],[0]
this is a I probably going to get locked in this room engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
yeah I'd be surprised if you don't,['Plan'],[20]
yeah,['0'],[0]
could you come in there is a critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 18]"
well closer,['0'],[0]
are GPS is bag,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
all right what kind was trapped me in,['HelpRequest'],[16]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay so this is a c,['0'],[0]
nothing else back here,['0'],[0]
okay and then,['Precedence'],[11]
don't break that door down there and see if there's anything there,"['Plan', 'Instruction']","[20, 19]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yes I have an SOS that's a c,['0'],[0]
did y'all hear me earlier that the GPS is back okay Roger that,['0'],[0]
we are all good,['0'],[0]
do you want to start working on the green side,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
the D4 should be cleared,['Room'],[3]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah let's go to i2a cuz it's a really critical one I think we should focus on getting,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
okay,['0'],[0]
definitely,['0'],[0]
it was because it's like three in there,['0'],[0]
I'm not even checking out age they can burn,"['Plan', 'Search']","[20, 15]"
it's for the greater good,['0'],[0]
exactly,['0'],[0]
honestly you're worth five times the value of another person,['0'],[0]
all right through here probably going to shut all this isn't it,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
and then on that green hallway there is some critical Zone,"['CriticalVictim', 'Precedence']","[1, 11]"
whereabouts are y'all,['0'],[0]
we're not i2a,['Instruction'],[19]
i2a Roger that,['0'],[0]
we are coming out of I2 I have a c right here and this is clear,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
got it yeah there's a critical right here,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
all right and your mom follow me,['Instruction'],[19]
yeah we're doing way better now,['0'],[0]

transfer you on take this one it's a b hold on right there that's a c that's a c,['0'],[0]
which one did I just pick up was the one I just picked up okay I'll take the C then come back for the B,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 11, 18]"
okay I'm playing the B outside the door,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
all right I'm still oh my gosh,['0'],[0]

that was like the hardest lag Spike,['0'],[0]
okay jeez,['0'],[0]
that hurt,['HelpRequest'],[16]
there's a critical down on the other side in the case if you don't want to head over this way next,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[20, 1, 13]"
okay,['0'],[0]
all right I am currently an i4 and then I will be there there's two people here,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[20, 3, 10, 11, 14]"
Roger that,['0'],[0]
okay I will be there next,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yeah there's two critical Zone this side yep,['0'],[0]
so,['0'],[0]
I'm in L3 clear in this out medic,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
this is a b all right,['0'],[0]
there's two in here one critical one normal,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
awesome I got that medic,['Medic'],[6]
you got 20 seconds left we can just get the critical and dip,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
yeah this is this is an a,['0'],[0]
what room engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
you said a as an alpha,['0'],[0]
yep what room engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
L3,['Room'],[3]
L3 okay I'm coming up there,"['Room', 'Move', 'Move']","[3, 10, 10]"
I'm sorry yeah L3,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah we ran out of time,['0'],[0]
oh yep,['0'],[0]
nevermind I think we're out of time jeez C,['0'],[0]

yeah let's go guys,"['Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Move']","[19, 19, 10]"
Ikea we did great,['0'],[0]
if I didn't know laugh 20 seconds,['0'],[0]
Open Door,['Instruction'],[19]
oops sorry click mad at us,['0'],[0]
and this is engineer I just finished the survey,['Engineer'],[4]
this is medic I'm time to study,['Medic'],[6]
transporter just finished Hill,['Transporter'],[5]
move,['0'],[0]
no thanks,['0'],[0]
okay there's three severe rooms three moderate rooms and three mild rooms in terms of danger,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
I don't think there's any point in telling you exactly which ones they are because you'll forget immediately,['Plan'],[20]
yep,['0'],[0]
I can try it at Market do you want me to go and Mark those or do you want me to like help and clear rubble and stuff,"['Plan', 'Rubble', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 7, 18, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay okay,['0'],[0]
no I transporter here I think we should start along the a section and go all the way to D and E and F and whatnot but this is specifically to medic I wouldn't step in a room with like because you I think you you're able to see the rubble so you don't want to get trapped so if you C Rubble don't enter that room unless the engineer Zone already because I won't enter into that room but I will label that there's Rubble but I'm gonna I'm gonna,"['HelpRequest', 'Rubble', 'Rubble', 'Transporter', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Move', 'Move', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Medic', 'Rubble']","[16, 7, 7, 5, 20, 20, 4, 10, 10, 13, 6, 7]"
come,['0'],[0]
along medic to every single room and I would prioritize the regular victims until the engineer gets to you because,"['Engineer', 'Medic', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[4, 6, 2, 2]"
I think the critical victims are more so in the rubble packed rooms but I can't get out of those yeah,"['CriticalVictim', 'Rubble']","[1, 7]"
the severe room c yeah they're in there most likely in severe rooms,['0'],[0]
most of the dangers in the middle or on the east as well,['0'],[0]
yeah that makes sense yeah I have I just I have knowledge that there were meetings going on at the time of the disaster and most meetings were being held on the right on the East right side of the map okay,"['Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9]"
I've things with two or more attendees and it was a management meeting lunch or a project meeting button,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
I think we start on the right start on the right not on the left yeah start on the right,['0'],[0]
starting to die so let's you want to go from l.a. all the way to a or em all the way to a,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay let's let's hit em on the far right let's go all the way down,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
okay,['0'],[0]
notice that M1 and M3 both are hazards K2 and j4 are as well on that side,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3]"
okay I die,['0'],[0]
okay so so M M1 is a hazard what else,['Room'],[3]
M3,['Room'],[3]
okay so I'm going to go into M2,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Room']","[20, 10, 3]"
oh no I can't really do anything in there but I can pull what type of victims in there so yeah critical victim here,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[1, 20, 2]"
also if you come across a victim just put them outside the room,['Victim'],[2]
there's there's no victim in M2,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Victim']","[13, 3, 2]"
M3 also has a critical victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room']","[1, 13, 3]"
of course,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm going to the elves now let me know when somebody's healed you can leave you can leave them out in the hallway,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20, 20]"
medic where are you,"['Question', 'Medic']","[17, 6]"
I'm popping in M3 looking for the,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
nope victims,['0'],[0]
there's M3 has danger I'm going to come,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
okay M3 yellow M3 has a critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room']","[1, 13, 3, 3]"
okay let me know when you see it,['0'],[0]
I'm here I'm here I'm clear and Rubble,['Rubble'],[7]
I need someone to heal the critical and there's also a normal one with B,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'RescueInteractions']","[1, 13, 2, 12]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I can take the normal,['Plan'],[20]
okay yes it's a b,['0'],[0]
you guys do you guys see the markers on placing,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
okay medic make your way to the marker Zone The Other Side you said there was a critical victim here,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'MarkerBlock', 'Medic']","[1, 13, 8, 6]"
M3 is M2 open sir M3 is empty,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3]"
M3 something there wasn't two victims,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
we got them both,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
there's no one in L3 and L2 you can make your way all the way down to L1 I'm going to start marking the Jace,"['Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 13, 3, 3, 3, 20, 2]"
let me just check j4 has a hazard K2 has a hazard,"['Instruction', 'Room', 'Room', 'Search']","[19, 3, 3, 15]"
you guys see the markers and placing now,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
yes,['0'],[0]
okay yeah,['0'],[0]
there's a lot of no victims in the eye section,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
okay you don't have to go you can I4 and j4 both have critical victims,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 3, 3, 13]"
so that should be fun,['0'],[0]
medic where are you,"['Question', 'Medic']","[17, 6]"
I am in K4 and yes there's Rubble here preventing me from there's two vectors to regular victims those Rubble in the way,"['Room', 'Victim', 'ReportLocation', 'Rubble', 'Rubble', 'Victim']","[3, 2, 14, 7, 7, 2]"

did we get the K2 and M1 yet,"['Room', 'Room', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 3, 18]"
we should probably get some victims,"['RescueInteractions', 'Victim']","[12, 2]"
neither think there's a critical here actually and K4 and j4 sorry if you want to help me,"['CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 19, 3, 3, 13]"
he's awake you should be able to do it,['0'],[0]
I can't oh I can't because,['0'],[0]
this one is hold on the one behind you is type B I'll take care of him you take care of the critical illness,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[1, 20, 2]"
critical is automatically C correct,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
you were talking about K1 and M1 or K2 when M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3]"
as the next,['0'],[0]
okay okay,['0'],[0]
yeah let's just go down go down the aisle and get all the critical zone or well all the victims already got some of the others,"['CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'Move', 'Victim']","[1, 19, 10, 2]"
really,['0'],[0]
I'm hitting K2 at the it's a hazard room,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
K2 K2,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay on my way,['Move'],[10]
it's going to be a right after you enter the room,"['Move', 'Precedence']","[10, 11]"
I will one regular type A,['Victim'],[2]
my critical,['0'],[0]
came to leave,['Move'],[10]

okay transporter here the whole map is labeled where do you guys need me now,['Transporter'],[5]
everything got collapsed on South Zone C while I was trying to bring someone E3 bring a victim in,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
hand me that victim and you can go,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
what color or what letter,['0'],[0]
C okay I'll just go across,['Plan'],[20]
critical c c yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah if you could just clear this area engineer,"['Plan', 'Engineer']","[20, 4]"
yeah you don't need you don't need you don't need a free South Zone C oh yeah whichever one you're closest to C North Zone C or South Zone C come to either because they're both trapped with rubble,"['HelpRequest', 'Rubble']","[16, 7]"
I can C4 thing so,['Room'],[3]
thank you,['0'],[0]
South Zone C is open,['0'],[0]
alright where are we heading now,['Question'],[17]
there's a couple over B K1,['Room'],[3]

I was over there and supposedly that was a critical guy,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
buttercup what is he,['0'],[0]
transporter take this he's a b b,['Transporter'],[5]
let's go over to what did we get the one at M1,"['Instruction', 'Room']","[19, 3]"
open up,['Instruction'],[19]
M1 and then we head up to j4 I4,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 10, 11]"
pass,['0'],[0]
I think one of the victims are in the wrong room,"['ReportLocation', 'Victim']","[14, 2]"
on the south side or north side,['0'],[0]
Southside okay,['0'],[0]
Southside Vermont I'm not sure that I could be a glitch,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
caring critical Southside C,['0'],[0]
I'm heading to I4 j4,"['Room', 'Room', 'Move']","[3, 3, 10]"
actually if you want to carry it this one to C transport,['Transporter'],[5]
engineer a medic coming to I4 in j4,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'Room', 'Medic', 'Move']","[4, 3, 3, 6, 10]"
yeah there was a victim who needed to go to a and not C,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
oh my God there's three criticals transporter coming to die for,['Transporter'],[5]
on my way,['Move'],[10]
can I want to stabilize,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
three critical Zone over here,['0'],[0]
come here way icon yep all particles,['Move'],[10]

okay I'm on my way back to I4,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
no I think we're we carried out them all,['0'],[0]
is there anybody else there also j4 j4 has a critical by the way,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 3, 3, 13]"
if you guys have done that room yet,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
j4 has a hazard as well,['Room'],[3]
do we clear this out,"['Instruction', 'YesNoQuestion']","[19, 18]"
it's odd that there's no victim here,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay I'll do it clear it out okay I thought you only carried two out okay,['Plan'],[20]
we should be good,['0'],[0]
yeah we're to go j4,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
j4 is clear,['Room'],[3]
yeah,['0'],[0]
j4 clear okay,['Room'],[3]
go down to H1,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
let's let's go to the we can go to G3 that's closer than H1 actually now let's go to H1 it's got H1 because there's a lot more people down there,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Plan', 'Move']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 19, 19, 20, 10]"
yep let's go,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
and it's right by Zone C so it's easy to transport away I'm going the wrong way oops,['0'],[0]
there's a,['0'],[0]
what H1 the small room within H1 is a trap right,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
right right in here yeah but are you ready let me out of it so try going again,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
I think it just re arms,['0'],[0]
okay we'll go ahead and try,['Plan'],[20]
you can come in here medic you can get in here he's on the other side of the injured person,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 6, 2]"
oh,['0'],[0]
yeah it does,['Instruction'],[19]
got trapped we're trapped so okay this one this one is an a,"['HelpRequest', 'HelpRequest']","[16, 16]"
I'm going to transport the critical victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
well let me fix it,['Instruction'],[19]
okay,['0'],[0]
actually I'll transport the A C and C is closer but yeah,['Plan'],[20]
I'll take you out take the,['Plan'],[20]
Vega,['0'],[0]
will do,['0'],[0]
and can you change the sign of that now and that's fine,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
good job all right let's go to H1,"['Room', 'Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Move']","[3, 19, 19, 10]"
that's also critical here oh no victim here,['Victim'],[2]
yep,['0'],[0]
it's the same one right now,['0'],[0]
all right into the dissection yeah,['0'],[0]
okay now let's go through D3 it go through D4 come down this way and then in this room there's a regular victim oh yeah right here all right,"['Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'Victim', 'Room', 'Room', 'Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Move', 'Move']","[11, 11, 2, 2, 3, 3, 19, 13, 10, 10, 10]"
okay this one is a b,['0'],[0]
this one is an a,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
there's a critical in here,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
oh there's another one,['0'],[0]
music I hear ya,['0'],[0]
so laying down the critical and fixing okay that one's okay that one was the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim']","[1, 1]"
this is critical,['0'],[0]
die,['Instruction'],[19]
no no this one is B except,['0'],[0]
okay we're going to B clear I think,['0'],[0]
let's head over to the c section,['Instruction'],[19]
we only have a few less than a minute,['0'],[0]
C2,['Room'],[3]
yeah that's so let's just do the critical room here yeah,"['CriticalVictim', 'Instruction']","[1, 19]"
right behind this wall right here,['0'],[0]
yeah engineer can you break this wall,"['Engineer', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 18]"
the regular is B I'm going to fix the critical do first,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
I can probably deliver him really quickly,['Plan'],[20]
he's a door trapped can you check,"['HelpRequest', 'ReportLocation', 'Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[16, 14, 15, 18]"
C,['0'],[0]
this one is B,['0'],[0]
one second zero,['0'],[0]
updates,['0'],[0]
that was gruesome,['0'],[0]
please please please dang it Pizza the end that's ridiculous,['0'],[0]
oops,['0'],[0]
no questions,['0'],[0]
blue question question,['0'],[0]
okay where is the concentration of of people,['0'],[0]
the meetings are going to be on the left side this time around,['Meeting'],[9]
okay,['0'],[0]
I think,['0'],[0]
left side all right I got a lot of Hazards in the GF any area and that usually indicates a lot of critical victims which are worth more points so,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
yeah I think I'm going to Mark exactly what I did last time but we should actually go for the critical victims the first,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[1, 20, 20]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I don't think you should go all over the place I think you should like just stick to one area at first that's where we will be because we can't keep up with you and if you go everywhere you won't be transporting victims back it's much faster for you to stay in the area that we are and transport victims back after scanning,"['Plan', 'Question', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[20, 17, 11, 2, 2]"
so what are you should I cover first the like a through C,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
yes yes yes,['0'],[0]
okay commit them West,['Instruction'],[19]
I suggest we go straight down the middle get the DH and then the E F G sections you scan those and while you're scanning we're going to be like going through the area I'm going to stick with the medic and then after that you come back you help us transport victims and then we move on to the west side was it the west side is where they victims were yes then we go on to the west side,"['Plan', 'Victim', 'Instruction', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[20, 2, 19, 6, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 2]"
okay sounds good,['0'],[0]
yeah I guess,['0'],[0]
so let's start with d and I'll mark everything there and then you guys can,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 11, 11]"
yeah there's a double hazard in D4 by the way,['Room'],[3]
okay and then you guys can move on to H and then go up to G,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 11, 11, 11]"
yes,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
okay dhg sounds good,['0'],[0]
yeah we're H2 is in the back so we'll hit that before we go to G,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
h,['0'],[0]
okay so d h ASO h1a h1a and H2 and then G,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
or I mean about,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I don't think yeah I don't think h1a h1a doesn't connect to H2 but let's do D and then H1 h1a and then go around to H2 just like you said yeah,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 10, 11, 11, 11]"
yep,['0'],[0]
so immediately start scanning D and then we'll go on,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 11, 11]"
you got it,['0'],[0]
sounds good,['0'],[0]
I met medic and trendy to,['Medic'],[6]
hit the critical victim first so we can free some cuz I think we'll be trapped with rubble or something yeah,"['HelpRequest', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Rubble']","[16, 1, 20, 20, 7]"
medic and A2 got to normal victims A and B I'm picking up B,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[3, 6, 2]"
I'll come pick up,['Plan'],[20]
actually it might be better if transporter immediately takes those,['Transporter'],[5]
in,['0'],[0]
I can pick up a blue,['Plan'],[20]
over there,['0'],[0]
okay okay I'll I'll mark it up placed it outside it marked it as B,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
thanks,['0'],[0]
this one is going to b a b,['0'],[0]
there's a critical in here,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
you come back make sure to delete the Vita,['0'],[0]
I'll pick up some C thank you,['Plan'],[20]
carrying C,['0'],[0]
we can go through D4 2H,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
correct,['0'],[0]
regular victim here and I'm going to check h1a,"['Plan', 'Victim', 'Search', 'Victim']","[20, 2, 15, 2]"
yeah just a regular victim,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
all right here gonna have A1 and a am B,['Room'],[3]
open up to H2 right now,['Room'],[3]
no one in H2,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
hold on,['Instruction'],[19]
what's an h1a nothing,['Question'],[17]
there should be regular victim though,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
C anybody in h1a just H1 there's two regular,['Room'],[3]
picking up the regular,['0'],[0]
okay there's no one in H2 so you guys can move to G after you finish there is everything good here,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Victim', 'Precedence']","[3, 13, 20, 10, 2, 11]"
medic worry okay,['Medic'],[6]
carrying a,['0'],[0]
taking B actually I shouldn't take B some I'll leave this for the transporter later,"['Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 5]"
sounds good,['0'],[0]

okay so on the B medic on the left side in A2,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
it's right next to the room we started in there should be a meeting as well as up in B9 which is the top side and your Zone a and then C4 as well which is about halfway up the left side of the map and then there's a lot of meetings going on on the right side in the green section as well as M3 so blue top right and M1 which is also on the right side,"['Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Question', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 9, 9, 11, 11, 17, 3, 13, 3, 3]"

okay we have zoom2 from office,['0'],[0]
that seems to be a mid like lower-end attendees both the zoom meetings have been canceled,['Meeting'],[9]

closer to the sum of the gates,['0'],[0]
the top one,['0'],[0]
this is engineer I am experiencing some lag,['Engineer'],[4]
transporter this is a type a victim right here,"['Transporter', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[5, 2, 2]"
I need help in this room here thank you,['HelpRequest'],[16]
we have this is engineer we have 30 seconds left and there are yes,"['Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move']","[4, 13, 10]"
engineer can you transport that victim it's of type c,"['CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 4, 2, 18]"
I'm running to Zone a North to deposit one more victim,['Victim'],[2]
push transporter would you mind swapping off with me,['Transporter'],[5]
that's a and this is a type B,['Victim'],[2]
oh,['0'],[0]
this is transporter we seem to have fallen,['Transporter'],[5]
this is engineer and I have completed the survey,['Engineer'],[4]
this is transporter I finished the survey,['Transporter'],[5]
this is engineer I completed the survey,['Engineer'],[4]
this is medic I4 turned,"['Room', 'Medic', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 6, 14]"
B is engineer I am back,['Engineer'],[4]
this is the transporter I've also returned,['Transporter'],[5]
medic is ready,['Medic'],[6]
transporter is ready,['Transporter'],[5]
engineer is ready,['Engineer'],[4]
nope,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
no,['0'],[0]
okay so do you want to run through what's been canceled or what has Rubble,['Rubble'],[7]
this is transporter yes so the things that have been cancelled are similar to last time zoom2 meetings and the storage reorganization have been canceled,"['Meeting', 'Transporter']","[9, 5]"
okay where do we have Rubble,['Rubble'],[7]
okay we have it training G3 we don't need to look that storage organization and then B6 is technical exchange meeting is that still on for today,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Search']","[3, 3, 9, 9, 11, 15]"
rooms with no damage severe damage is i2a G3 B6 okay,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
technical exchange this is transporter technical exchange meeting is one of the high 10 B account ones,"['Meeting', 'Transporter']","[9, 5]"
okay just learning from last time this is medic I think our best course is transporter running through and marking rooms and me and engineer running through to deal with the high risk because there will likely be Rubble there and transport if you're running past a room that has someone and you can just bring them out into the hallway that's easier because it's easier to go down the big Hall ways than navigate,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Rubble', 'Transporter']","[4, 20, 6, 7, 5]"
sight of rooms,['0'],[0]
this is engineer I was thinking a very similar thing like if we C victims that are not critical that we can bring into the hall for medic that would be a good strategy this time,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[4, 20, 6, 20, 2]"
right,['0'],[0]
Trying to minimize their times in the rooms,['0'],[0]
this is transporter sounds good,['Transporter'],[5]
all right,['0'],[0]
okay so what zone do you want to start off with this is a medic left center right side,"['Medic', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 18]"
I,['0'],[0]
we could start left because you said B6 was a big meeting,"['Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 9]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yes this is engineer at there are a lot of Hazards this time on the map,['Engineer'],[4]
medic walls open,['Medic'],[6]

okay and this is engineer I am on my way,"['Engineer', 'Move']","[4, 10]"
so if you could just we are both stuck at the moment,['HelpRequest'],[16]
after we are unstuck I believe we should focus on placing any,['Precedence'],[11]
safe victims,['Victim'],[2]
as medic we have less than a minute left,"['Medic', 'Move']","[6, 10]"
this is transporter a great engineer there is a victim in here that you could pick up as well when you go,"['Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[4, 13, 5, 2]"

cool,['0'],[0]
yes but let's see I think more importantly what do you guys think about starting on the right side now should we still do the left side start because we rubbed it really well or should we go right side because it seems pretty linear,"['YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[18, 18]"
let's do this is transported let's do right side because it is pretty linear,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
that sounds good,['0'],[0]
that should be yeah there's,['0'],[0]
cool,['0'],[0]
not as much room C and it is B it'll be easy for me to go through and check each of them,['Search'],[15]
perfect perfect,['0'],[0]
and that'll be an easy check,['0'],[0]
okay and we're still going with the game plan where transporter goes ahead and like marks the rooms and then me and medic engineer and medic work room to room,"['Engineer', 'Question', 'Medic', 'Medic', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[4, 17, 6, 6, 20, 11, 11, 5]"

Okay one minute timer is up please and Adam basically friend yeah they're close Okay green participants as a reminder you're encouraged to communicate with your teammates during the mission always blue suit your extended to make sure that it's your call zone for example if your engineer today this is ground janilla,['Engineer'],[4]
awesome,['0'],[0]
Israel also that Revival of a wall will be at the starting zone and we will meeting there for two minutes B uses,"['Plan', 'Meeting']","[20, 9]"

F4 engineer,"['Engineer', 'Room']","[4, 3]"
engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
so now that you're all facing the wall after five second countdown to move B will start remember the wall will disappear after 2 minutes and then enter the question building do you have any questions before we begin now from transporter I4 engineer,"['Engineer', 'Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion', 'Move', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[4, 5, 18, 10, 3, 11, 11, 11, 11]"
then we will start in 5 4 3 2 1 all right,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
when we will start in five four three two all right great job last time I think that our strategy worked out pretty well personally I think that I just put two and two together we should highly prioritized a meeting set er down there in the critical Mission information I looked at it last time but I think that should be a priority meeting that I don't think that transport C I don't think you have to check those because those should be sure that they're there so I think you just,"['Victim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Plan', 'Search', 'Search', 'Transporter']","[2, 1, 20, 9, 9, 20, 15, 15, 5]"
on transport you should capitalize the ones that are not mentioned and the critical Mission information just to confirm we all see that A1 A4 B2 B6 etcetera,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Transporter']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 5]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
this is transporter no I do not see that,['Transporter'],[5]
you do not see that interesting alright so transporter please on the left side do not check A1 A4 B2 or B6 in fact what is your guys's critical meeting admission information look like,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Search', 'Search', 'Transporter']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 15, 15, 5]"
transporter my critical Mission says on the left side red two or more attendees in technical exchange meeting lunch management meeting in the middle,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Transporter']","[9, 9, 9, 5]"
as orange one attendees IT training facilities meeting Human Resources meeting and on the green cancelled storage reorganization zoom2 meeting and zoom2 from the office,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9, 9]"
this is engineer my current location information of the severe damage is i2a,['Engineer'],[4]
this is engineer my critical Mission information tells me rooms with no damage so the severe damage is in i2a G3 B6 moderate has A1 F4 B2 mild this M1 D4 A4,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3]"
engineer severe damage i2a fantastic so mind tells me basically where there's a large grouping of people as medic engineer years tells you where is it there's a lot of damage and then what is yours tell you transporter,"['Engineer', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Question', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[4, 4, 13, 17, 6, 11, 11, 5]"
what Ariel is had a question gotcha,['0'],[0]
this transfer I believe it's saying what areas have at least two or more attendees one attendees and cancelled so where people probably are not,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
so that's just extra information for you know friend fantastic so in that case if there's nothing for you to do please follow the critical Mission information button that b clearing out debris marking stuff or whatever y'all were doing great last time but you see we can optimize stuff,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
is it transporter we still going right,['Transporter'],[5]
okay,['0'],[0]
we are going to go right yes starting off at the green said,['Plan'],[20]

this is medic I don't have any questions,['Medic'],[6]
okay this is medic I have some thoughts about how we should go around doing this it I think we can share some ideas but I'll go first I think it might be wise for transporter to effectively wait I believe it was transported that had the ability to C into room C,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Transporter']","[20, 20, 6, 5]"
C which ones were threat rooms,['Room'],[3]
I think we can start with each lettered room so we go from A1 a4a and then B yada yada have the person determine which ones are threat rooms Mark those otherwise the eye the medic and the other team members sticks with me to mark critical,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Room', 'Victim']","[3, 20, 6, 11, 3, 2]"
or not critical,['0'],[0]
victims and put them out in the hallway so we can expedite things,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
this is transporter I think that's a good idea but the transporter can see what type of critical or normal regular victim is in a room the engineer does that so I think engineer should do that,"['Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Victim', 'Transporter', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[4, 4, 20, 2, 5, 5, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
this is engineer I can tell you which rooms are threats and I have a list of most dangerous rooms with me but before you enter a room call out and I'll tell you if it is sensuous,"['Plan', 'Engineer', 'Move', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 4, 10, 20, 11]"
oh so you already have all of the you have a list of the threat rooms,['Room'],[3]
some of them I know the most severe ones are i4a E5 and C4 and appears the most severe ones are the ones with the critical victims,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room']","[3, 1, 3]"
okay let's start heading over to the a section while we talk about this further I have Mission information saying that there are indeed people in those set rooms all of those e mentioned so that's worth knowing that we can tackle those as a team when we get to them,['Plan'],[20]

this is transporter we have 30 seconds left this is transporter I will go crazy,"['Plan', 'Transporter', 'Transporter']","[20, 5, 5]"
this is medic I suppose this was really good progress,['Medic'],[6]
this is transport door I suppose it was very good progress as well,"['ReportLocation', 'Transporter']","[14, 5]"
this is engineer I concur,['Engineer'],[4]
this is medic I just fell to my death all right,['Medic'],[6]
this is medic do you guys have any any feedback for the last session,['Medic'],[6]
this is transporter no but maybe we should be faster just a little bit,['Transporter'],[5]
this is my room what we could do is start on a and then work all the way around the perimeter through Shea and L and then finish through dnf,"['Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[11, 11, 11, 14]"
maybe I will will it go faster,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
this is medic I think,['Medic'],[6]
you could be on to something there because I realized a lot of the inefficiencies were in like getting in and out of D and E and F,['0'],[0]
and all that so maybe what we could do this time is try to do a b c,['0'],[0]
and then go to i j k l and m,['Precedence'],[11]
this is transporter I think that's a good idea,['Transporter'],[5]
engineer I also if we start on a,['Engineer'],[4]
A3 C2 C3 and C5 a role threat Grooms so we can for well enter in,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Plan']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 10, 20]"
okay this is medic I think it might be an interesting idea if we decide to put the collect the victims in the hallway and after we're done with the section put them into the zones because I feel as if a lot of the time that we wasted was just moving back and forth between like putting victims in each place,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[20, 6, 11, 2, 2]"
all right this is engineer so have the transporter Mark every room first and then begin transporting the victims,"['Engineer', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[4, 11, 11, 5, 2]"
move,['0'],[0]
yeah this is medic I think it might be a might be a good idea for a while engineer and I go through a b c have transported her head over to IJ k m and L and Mark those,"['Engineer', 'Medic']","[4, 6]"
this is transporter so you want me to do that right now,['Transporter'],[5]
yes it would be nice to this is medic if you could continue through A B C 0 if you could continue through a b c,"['Plan', 'Medic']","[20, 6]"
this is C engineer there are two big themes in A3,"['Room', 'Engineer']","[3, 4]"
this is medic there are some people in the hallway already also A3 is currently blocked because of a threat so I'm going to move on to B2 really quickly which also needs an engineer help,"['Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Move']","[3, 3, 20, 4, 6, 10]"
I move in the victim as she move the victims from inside j3 to outside,"['Room', 'Move', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 10, 2, 2]"

this is medic and transport if you'd be so kind as to break the signs for a and b victims as you pick them up,"['Medic', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[6, 5, 2]"
thank you it's all good,['0'],[0]
this is transporting yeah I'm sorry,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
this is medic I believe a B and C are complete so with engineer we are going to head to I and J hallway,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Move', 'Move']","[20, 20, 4, 6, 10, 10]"
I follow you,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
medic I think we should begin well we should go to I2 C the threat room so they're more critical big things here,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Move', 'Room']","[3, 6, 10, 3]"
engineer a curry,['Engineer'],[4]
specialist I can tell this is medic that is the only victim in this hallway or in this room,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[20, 6, 2]"
all right,['0'],[0]
I'm going to head to i3,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
that is hit B victim,['Victim'],[2]
B,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
this is a c victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'Victim']","[1, 2]"
thank you clear,['0'],[0]
this is engineer I lost my GPS,['Engineer'],[4]
this is transported me to,['0'],[0]
this is medic like was,['Medic'],[6]
thank you,['0'],[0]
medic the other victim I really brought outside,"['Medic', 'Victim']","[6, 2]"
it's,['0'],[0]
so currently engineer and I are in the IJ hallway we're going to continue with the strategy that we've been doing in putting victims in the hallway but we are going to check every room this time because engineer can still see threats correct,"['Plan', 'Victim', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'ReportLocation', 'Search']","[20, 2, 4, 4, 20, 20, 14, 15]"
ah,['0'],[0]
I cannot but I can tell you ashy we are en el,['Plan'],[20]
I don't have information on l,['0'],[0]
always blue,['0'],[0]
there is a critical victim inside of L3,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room']","[1, 13, 3]"
tastic,['0'],[0]
this is medic understood,['Medic'],[6]
since we are going to keep going down the hall okay there are critical pick themes on K1,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
this is transporter I'm on my way,"['Move', 'Transporter']","[10, 5]"
transporter all this safe zones are still clear right,['Transporter'],[5]
this is transporter yes I believe so,['Transporter'],[5]
this is medic I'm stuck outside of K1 where you are engineer,"['HelpRequest', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Medic']","[16, 4, 3, 6]"
yep,['0'],[0]
i1 regular and one critical,['Room'],[3]
okay if you'd be so kind as to take the regular outside,['0'],[0]
done,['0'],[0]
and C B ass is back,['0'],[0]
this is medic I have GPS back,['Medic'],[6]
it's it,['0'],[0]
this is medic there are victims in,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[13, 6, 2]"
this side of the hallway that we're all on okay,['0'],[0]
only on the last room I believe,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
engineer are you able to see if this is a threat room,"['Plan', 'Engineer', 'ReportLocation', 'Room']","[20, 4, 14, 3]"
hey there is not print you may get blocked off anyway,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
engineer let's head across this North section to the middle,['Engineer'],[4]
this is transporter the soon as I die I will check those rooms right now,"['Plan', 'Search', 'Transporter']","[20, 15, 5]"
thank you,['0'],[0]
this is your I'm going to be taking the critical in the meantime is there a pig Tim right between H1 and one a one,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Room', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 20, 3, 18]"
this is transporter yes there is,['Transporter'],[5]
this is transporter there's a critical victim over here in this room,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Transporter']","[1, 13, 5]"
thank you this is medic I'm at the critical victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'Medic']","[1, 6]"
what is your room medic,"['Medic', 'Question']","[6, 17]"
E5,['Room'],[3]
it's critical right,['0'],[0]
as an a victim,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
okay a victim,['Victim'],[2]
there's still a critical victim in here engineer if you'd like to assist,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[20, 1, 4, 13]"
no way,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
team we have 90 seconds,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
say C victim,"['Instruction', 'Victim']","[19, 2]"
it's good engineer let's get this critical and then I think we should start ringing,"['Engineer', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[4, 11, 11]"
C critical,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
victim C over to transporter,"['Transporter', 'Victim']","[5, 2]"
this is transporter I think I've marked most of the rooms that are left,"['Move', 'Transporter']","[10, 5]"
this is a medic thank you very much,['Medic'],[6]
I'm headed into D4 to take care of this critical and regular victim,"['Room', 'Move', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 10, 2, 2]"
transporter is there a untreated victim on the south hallway or a search just a leftover marker,"['MarkerBlock', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[8, 5, 2]"
likely left over,['Move'],[10]
this is transporter which boy H1,"['Room', 'Transporter']","[3, 5]"
the one below H1 and one a what i1a,['Room'],[3]
yeah there's someone there,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
15 seconds,['0'],[0]
oh my God,['0'],[0]
that is a b,['0'],[0]
this is medic I'm just going to take this person over here that is a b,"['Medic', 'Victim']","[6, 2]"
what is it,['Question'],[17]
I don't think I can make it I know I'm so close,['Plan'],[20]
blue,['0'],[0]
you better now than ever,['0'],[0]
it is C over 2 by the way right,['0'],[0]
I'm server too,['0'],[0]
okay I went to a server one,['0'],[0]
gotcha,['0'],[0]
there is a wall in the way,['0'],[0]
okay so I guess we can talk so I guess we can talk amongst ourselves in,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
red,['0'],[0]
okay this is so so from what we saw earlier i4a there were three critical victims it look like so I guess we should we would need three people search quickly so we can transport all three of them I guess,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan', 'Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 13, 20, 15, 18]"
yep,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
mmm,['0'],[0]
that's not smart,['0'],[0]
okay so you want to do the same like style where we start in that top right corner I think the best way to go about is like even if it takes a little bit of time at the beginning for you two to get victims out yourselves if I'm running around and just marking doors I think we can save a lot of time not looking into rooms,"['Plan', 'Move', 'RescueInteractions', 'Victim']","[20, 10, 12, 2]"
yes,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
right,['0'],[0]
yeah so so the medic and I will work on trying to get as much as many victims rescue as we can and you mark off the doors and then I guess after that it wherever I see Rubble or or if you are trapped room room ceiling I'll fix that if you get stuck I will also come in help,"['Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Rubble', 'Victim', 'HelpRequest', 'HelpRequest', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[6, 11, 11, 11, 7, 2, 16, 16, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay medic what what did you say the meeting rooms were outside of the I4,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Meeting']","[3, 6, 9]"
are you said,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
M1 M3 okay,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
so on the right side you mean like on the map yeah on the right side there were I2 that i4a then M1 and M3 D4 yeah in the middle they were D2 and E5,"['Precedence', 'ReportLocation', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room']","[11, 14, 3, 3, 3, 3, 13, 3, 3]"
D2 E5 okay,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
and on the left side there A2 B9 + C4,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3]"
yeah I do it,['0'],[0]
it appears to be the case,['0'],[0]
okay you have that information available later correct okay we'll just we'll start on the right and work our way left,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
that sounds good,['0'],[0]
mmm,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
go team go,['Instruction'],[19]
and then we do I think we should have some sort of system for marking like when we get a victim out,"['Precedence', 'RescueInteractions', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[11, 12, 2, 18]"
yeah that's good well it's taking,['0'],[0]
then we will put no victims right,"['Plan', 'Victim', 'Precedence']","[20, 2, 11]"
mmm,['0'],[0]
yes yep you're right,['0'],[0]
all right so same strategy,['Plan'],[20]
cool beans,['0'],[0]
I see the a here,['0'],[0]
y'all see what you can do on your own will I'd work my way there slowly,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
your dad's you're totally good that's the game plan,['Plan'],[20]
nice,['0'],[0]
also it's the engineering building i c interesting,['Engineer'],[4]
K-O-K I4,['Room'],[3]
role most of these are empty,['0'],[0]
that's why I'm thinking like I don't want to waste time,['Plan'],[20]
looking through empty room so I don't want you guys to have to waste time looking through empty rooms this most of them are empty,['0'],[0]
yeah all right sir,['0'],[0]
let's open this up,['Instruction'],[19]
okay we need one more person here,['Victim'],[2]
I'll give you the role of these are C,['Plan'],[20]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay want to transport this verse like let's go,['0'],[0]
okay I'll try I've got one right I got what I'm transporting,['Plan'],[20]
that goes into Zone C is that correct,['0'],[0]
okay even though yeah all of these very critical yet,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay notice,['0'],[0]
all the rooms on the green and blue are marked,['0'],[0]
other victims to grab,['Victim'],[2]
after I4 let's go to j4 because it's like next door and there's like critical victim sir,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Instruction', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[1, 3, 19, 3, 13, 10, 11, 14]"
okay,['0'],[0]
Muhammad L3 occur,['Room'],[3]
okay I am on the outs here let suppose C L1 j4 is a trap room it looks like so,"['Room', 'Room', 'Search']","[3, 3, 15]"
yeah so open up j4 tool then I'll put the third person from I4,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[20, 3, 3, 11, 2]"
and the drop point,['0'],[0]
okay yeah,['0'],[0]
okay I'm in j4 I am clearing out the rubble there is a critical victim and a normal victim in here,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'ReportLocation', 'Rubble']","[1, 3, 13, 2, 14, 7]"
I'm coming to j4 undivided,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
okay I'm right at the door,['ReportLocation'],[14]
let's see how the door is block there we go,['Instruction'],[19]
so wait which which category is this victim,['Victim'],[2]
okay this is being freaking pick up the B of first leg middle so like,['0'],[0]
yep that's the closest Basic close as I can get there quickly well,['Plan'],[20]
icon,['0'],[0]
and I think the c c is,['0'],[0]
so is this room done we're gonna do like tool,['0'],[0]
where is where is the exit oh okay I guess let me put the,['0'],[0]
victim down and clear out the Trap,['Victim'],[2]
so the room Zone the right there were only two people in C4,['Room'],[3]
okay,['0'],[0]
seems Seems like it I'll go ahead put down a no victim marker,"['Plan', 'MarkerBlock', 'Victim']","[20, 8, 2]"
yeah I think I can try K4 now because it's like close and they're like stairs something,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
okay I guess I'll go take a look at I'll go take a look down I guess,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
okay engineer I need your help in K4 they're like to victim here but there's Rubble,"['Engineer', 'HelpRequest', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'Victim']","[4, 16, 3, 13, 7, 2]"
all right I'm on the way,['0'],[0]
just a K4,['Room'],[3]
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm also on the way I can take a victim if needed,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 2]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah you're faster transporting them than I am,['0'],[0]
okay so I'll just fix them,['Plan'],[20]
oh yep I've also cleared out,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay yeah there's a victim over here,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
and yeah you can you all can identify them,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
victim wait up I'll tell you what these types are the last ones a the right one is B,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
I have a,['0'],[0]
because that's the floor this one,['ReportLocation'],[14]
yeah okay I'm picking up the B1,['Room'],[3]
okay there is nothing and in the meeting room and E3 like you said but there's a critical and E3 just next door,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Meeting']","[1, 3, 3, 13, 9]"
what you just said there was nothing in E3 and also something in E3,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
or I'm sorry B,['0'],[0]
in M1 there's something right and once to left,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Move']","[13, 3, 10]"
English,['0'],[0]
yep need help animals,['HelpRequest'],[16]
oh yeah M1 I'm I'll head towards M1 so it also seems like there's somebody in L1 let's see what we're dealing with here,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move']","[20, 3, 3, 3, 10]"
engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
I don't see anybody in L1 yeah,['Room'],[3]
on the way,['0'],[0]
I need you and M1 because there's rubble and also I need like one more person to fix this,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Rubble', 'Victim']","[13, 3, 7, 2]"
on the way I am almost,['0'],[0]
seems to be yes,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay also just to confirm I4 is completely clear correct okay,['Room'],[3]
okay where are you okay,['0'],[0]
okay and room on the top like M1 I believe it's M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 3, 14]"
I mean M1 isn't it has no I just I can't see which one this is its M1 storage tea,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
oh the the critical level in the north of here there's also a critical among the South,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 1, 13]"
the one with the grid critical the one on North yeah the em on the North like rightmost yeah yeah yeah not one I'm in the north one,['0'],[0]
okay that makes more sense I'm on the way oh jeez,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay first let's fix this and you can carry this guy because this goes to C and I'll pick up the other one and put it okay you can take this one,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20, 20]"
okay just making sure you can still get out after that,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
yeah okay I will just go and B,['Plan'],[20]
okay where do we go next we can go to the m actually on the south when we were talking about Drake,"['Question', 'Plan']","[17, 20]"
yeah we can do that let me just hurry and get to see real quick and yeah so I guess you start heading to the south side,['Plan'],[20]
yeah I'm going to the m room on the south which has set critical person,"['CriticalVictim', 'Move']","[1, 10]"
all right,['0'],[0]
okay there's just one critical person here but I need someone,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
yep I'm on the way,['0'],[0]
Ike,['0'],[0]
okay I have most marked now you guys should just tell me what to do like guide me where you need me to run victims,"['Move', 'Victim']","[10, 2]"
hmm,['0'],[0]
let's see here what's what what should be the next critical we go after because that's worth the most points,"['Instruction', 'Precedence']","[19, 11]"
yeah that's true,['0'],[0]
cracked critical and E3,['Room'],[3]
let's see your E5 let's hear it,"['Room', 'Instruction']","[3, 19]"
we could go to H1 because it's close to where,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
if you guys are done with the right section,['0'],[0]
what was the what was the were there any victims in the E5 or C4,"['Room', 'Room', 'Question', 'Victim']","[3, 3, 17, 2]"
there was an a victim in critical and E3 but that's it,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2, 2]"
correct,['0'],[0]
I'll take this,['Plan'],[20]
critical and C4,['Room'],[3]
okay nothing nothing else in any of the other he's okay and anything in C4 there's a critical in C4 I will start heading that way because that room also has Rubble,"['Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[3, 3, 1, 20, 13, 7]"
okay so medic can I meet you at E3,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 20, 6, 18]"
okay I'll see you at C4,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
yep you'll probably get the victim put in there and make it to C4 all before I can even get them help yep,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[3, 20, 20, 11, 2]"
oh my gosh I like elastic area,['0'],[0]
okay so the reaction rate first I going to which room and then C4,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
I,['0'],[0]
oh I'm sight engineer we need you at E3 there's Rubble,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[3, 4, 13, 7]"
E3 okay,['Room'],[3]
oh,['0'],[0]
hey engineer first going to clear this out because you were here the C is like table,['Engineer'],[4]
wow,['0'],[0]
I guess position-wise where are you to engineer,"['Engineer', 'Question']","[4, 17]"
thousands C,['0'],[0]
I am at C yes Elton C,['0'],[0]
got it I will be there,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
okay can you get in,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
okay okay it's a medic where do I need to go,['Medic'],[6]
okay let's see here and I'm heading this way this is the engineer which room did you say you needed help with,"['Engineer', 'HelpRequest', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 16, 18]"
follow green it is E3 yes so both,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
all right E3 okay I lost green green Green is too fast,['Room'],[3]
yeah true,['0'],[0]
I'm sorry medic we need your E3 as well,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
okay I'm trying to see where E3 it is,"['Plan', 'Room']","[20, 3]"
yep I see what you mean,['0'],[0]
okay I see it,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
hmm,['0'],[0]
there you go,['Move'],[10]
I guess transporter here there so I'll go ahead and work out work my way through let's see here,"['Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 5]"
yeah C4 I'll head that way,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
C4 okay medic you should go with I will take that person,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Victim']","[3, 20, 6, 2]"
okay yeah you can take this,['Plan'],[20]
how do I get out of here,['Question'],[17]
I know it's confusing maybe this corner here,['0'],[0]
this way I think this is right,['0'],[0]
yes and get up,['Instruction'],[19]
wait and see,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
oh shoot engineer while you're here can you clear this to get to Zone C,"['Engineer', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 18]"
when did this get blocked,['0'],[0]
sure,['0'],[0]
I'll see you said have to go to C4 right,"['Room', 'Plan']","[3, 20]"
correct C2 and C4 should be the next,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay I'll go to C4,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move']","[3, 20, 10]"
yeah I'm heading I'm heading to C away C4 I need to navigate through to the South side door,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move']","[3, 20, 10]"
how are you can,['0'],[0]
okay okay just doesn't look like there's a hallway here but okay,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[13, 13]"
you can get through this way engineer or whichever way you're going you're good both ways will get you there I can point you in the right direction,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[4, 20, 20]"
yeah hmm we can go to C4 and then C 2 right because both of them have like critical victims,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 1, 20, 10, 11]"
oh I see oh that's sneaky,['0'],[0]
okay so I'm heading towards C4 perfect you got the medic here,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Move']","[3, 6, 10]"
that's a tool,['0'],[0]
Jason,['0'],[0]
so should I go drop it should I okay I'll go drop it,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18, 18]"
if you leave them outside the door I can also drop them right Council room them,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
actually that's a good idea,['0'],[0]
actually here so okay I'm dropping in at I'm dropping it at C4,['Room'],[3]
okay it's C2 is C2 clear door no,"['Room', 'Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 3, 14]"
no no no let's go,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
okay oh there's Rubble in here,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[13, 7]"
yep,['0'],[0]
so I guess medic perfect,['Medic'],[6]
so the right one is a b tight and this is obviously a critical one,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
okay I'll take care of the B type,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
okay I'll take the C and then that's,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 20, 11, 11]"
and let's also put a hang on step back please,['Instruction'],[19]
clear oh yeah the clear,['0'],[0]
hmm,['0'],[0]
where are you guys I can run people as well,['Plan'],[20]
yep I'll put down a dam,['Plan'],[20]
okay okay wait where'd you go,['Question'],[17]
I'm,['0'],[0]
transport,['Transporter'],[5]
I am right behind you,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay this goes to B,['0'],[0]
I'm on the way to South Zone C,['0'],[0]
engineer I need you at South Zone C because there's Rubble again room should I try at the North one like if that's better okay,"['Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 13, 7, 18]"
how did Rubble get there again,"['Question', 'Rubble']","[17, 7]"
okay all doors are marked,['0'],[0]
we had once again yeah,['0'],[0]
I guess the lie I guess we get it just keeps getting placed here so I guess the goal is to just clear out the middle part which is just what we need,['0'],[0]
mmm,['0'],[0]
okay so just to confirm we have the entire right third completed and the middle completed as well,['0'],[0]
sorry,['0'],[0]
what zones do we have completed the right and the middle are we now just working on the left,"['YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[18, 18]"
I have not really been keeping track,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
we haven't done the D1,['Room'],[3]
a D1 is to people,['Room'],[3]
I'm taking I'm doing a 2d area right now let's see okay you got okay are any of these,['Plan'],[20]
engineer where did you say you were going in,['Engineer'],[4]
okay,['0'],[0]
I currently I was I currently went to check D1 so I was close to put sincere you can transport fast button,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Search']","[3, 20, 15]"
I'll just mark this,['Plan'],[20]
okay okay yeah just Mark both of these and head to the Next Room,['0'],[0]
Otis out does H1 have a critical in it I'll go take a look and see if there's Rubble die again,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[20, 1, 20, 3, 13, 7]"
okay I'm leaving those I've just bought them okay I'm gonna go to H1,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
yet there are victims in here and you don't edit it looks like there's Rubble at you but there's a path to get to them so,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'Search', 'Victim']","[13, 13, 7, 15, 2]"
okay let me see,['Instruction'],[19]
so I suppose I can Rush one of them over to save Zone C yes,['Plan'],[20]
are you sure there's a path like icon find it,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
yeah yeah there is here unless it got blocked here,['0'],[0]
okay just clear it cool okay,['0'],[0]
okay I'll take care of this of this one once you've done whatever,['Plan'],[20]
okay you can take that one and I'll take the other one,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
all right,['0'],[0]
I think you guys should leave it out and Mark it and move on to the next one I can move it,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
exactly,['0'],[0]
okay got it,['0'],[0]
well I'm already almost at C so I might just drop it off close to c a block with rubble again,['Rubble'],[7]
okay seems like it's good bam,['0'],[0]
okay what what room next severe done with h the,['0'],[0]
time-wise are you guys closer to B8 or A2,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
I am closer to A2,['Room'],[3]
A2 close A2 A2 yeah,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3]"
all right let's go to A2 there's a regular and a critical,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move']","[3, 1, 19, 19, 19, 13, 10]"
there's also something in A1 I guess,['Room'],[3]
hmm I think it is going to be the last one bigger one and a half minutes left,['Move'],[10]
oh we oh yeah we only have one and half minute oh God,['0'],[0]
engineer check A1 in case there's Rubble there because we don't need you for,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[3, 4, 13, 7]"
all right,['0'],[0]
can you can take good,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
there is there is Rubble but it's not really any sort of problem there are two victims in here though,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'Victim']","[13, 13, 7, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay both you guys take those I will run this critical,['Plan'],[20]
okay yeah over here in A1 then,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
which types are which,['Question'],[17]
engineer okay yeah let's seek okay left one is B right when it's a,"['Engineer', 'Instruction']","[4, 19]"
yeah you took the B mmm,['0'],[0]
okay I'll guess I'll take the B1 so that's this one like okay yeah B is significant,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[3, 20, 20]"
okay,['0'],[0]
all right engineer here engineer or engineer drop it I can dig B I think engineer move to A4,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Engineer', 'Plan']","[3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 20]"
bam A4,['Room'],[3]
yes there is a critical that's the top left corner,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
you have one minute,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah but I'm going to go drop the a so that's taking some time,['Plan'],[20]
here we go we're going to need we're going to need to be quick here,['Move'],[10]
yep so,['0'],[0]
A4,['Room'],[3]
here there are two good teams here at A4,['Room'],[3]
okay which room A4 is still far is too far,['Room'],[3]
you can you can move around here engineer,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 20, 10, 18]"
30 seconds,['0'],[0]
okay here we go critical let's wake him up,['Instruction'],[19]
however one of them has to be a medic after that,"['Medic', 'Precedence']","[6, 11]"
you contrary I can you yeah I'm so on,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
B I don't think I'll make it,['Plan'],[20]
okay let's see here oh God this room gets blocked okay so I will stand here and wait for the for for y'all to get through here and let you out again,['Plan'],[20]
okay yeah give a shot on this,['0'],[0]
no time no time 10 seconds,['0'],[0]
oh God,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
run,['0'],[0]
would you say it was a what type is that,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
AAA the one you pick this a,['0'],[0]
oh whoa,['0'],[0]
yeah we can do so much better than that oh,['Plan'],[20]
yeah,['0'],[0]
my reward,['0'],[0]
she stands with us getting killed,['0'],[0]
so you said section B mission one reflection,['0'],[0]
this is C medic I'm done with the surgery,['Medic'],[6]
this is transporter I'm done as well,['Transporter'],[5]
okay this is the engineer I'm done,['Engineer'],[4]
is there a way I could is there we can mute myself,['Plan'],[20]
I die I'm trying I'm trying figure out how to do that with my entire strategy,['Plan'],[20]
transporter is here,['Transporter'],[5]
it's a medic on block as well yeah,['Medic'],[6]
exactly,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay I think we should start out with the I rooms because you guys need to go into those to search through all of them I think by the time you guys are done with those eight rooms I can Mark almost every single one of the rooms here medic I think the best plan would be to drop the victims outside the door or if they're in the safe place just mark them and leave them and then run on to the next one just keep getting everybody safe and I will be moving them as fast as possible,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Move', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[20, 6, 10, 20, 11, 11, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
pass,['0'],[0]
exactly so I2 is also on my list here,['Room'],[3]
mmm,['0'],[0]
medic do you know where the technical exchange meeting and lunch and management meetings or,"['Medic', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 9, 9, 9, 18]"
Yeah the technical exchanges in B6 the lunch is an F4 and what do you say the threat thing,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 9]"
B6 F4 at the management meeting,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 9]"
demolishing meeting is D4,"['Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 9]"
mmm,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
hmm,['0'],[0]
yeah yep yep okay so,['0'],[0]
okay those are likely to more attendees so I will remember those but I'll mark them that's going to B after we'd clear that first third yeah I guess like I think last time I spend a lot of time just like walking around and standing around definitely use me to run victims especially long distances versus you doing them yourself yes so call for me and then say like victim and I3 red E2 move,"['Precedence', 'Victim', 'Victim', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[11, 2, 2, 20, 20, 3, 3, 10, 11, 11]"
or whatever you guys are,['0'],[0]
say it again,['Instruction'],[19]
so we start from the red button just to confirm i2a is the first room,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
okay let's start the start on the right side i2a,['Instruction'],[19]
I should be okay as I'm not going into any of the buildings,['0'],[0]
you're totally good I think that's the point,['0'],[0]
okay I see only one critical role in i2a,['0'],[0]
just one right I will keep it at the door open,['Plan'],[20]
yeah yeah but I kept it like this so I had a critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
actually as well oh yeah this works I think what room room likes,['0'],[0]
no nothing here nothing I'll mark it as Steel,['Plan'],[20]
or do you want to just go to the marker on J1,"['Room', 'MarkerBlock']","[3, 8]"
okay,['0'],[0]
so the left one is a red one is B I'll do a marker,"['Plan', 'MarkerBlock']","[20, 8]"
left one was a right one was big,['0'],[0]
I just left the,['0'],[0]
floor the transporter and let's go K1 are engineer there's some Rubble in at the entrance,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'Transporter']","[4, 19, 3, 13, 7, 5]"
yeah here's some Rubble yeah,['Rubble'],[7]
nice,['0'],[0]
yeah I'll just leave it at the door so that was critical this one is a type A oh okay,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
nope drop the move on I can got the a I am actually right next door so,['Plan'],[20]
okay how do I Market,['0'],[0]
okay all the first and second thirds are marked,['0'],[0]
do you want to check all rooms or do the middle section which is already like marked,"['Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[15, 18]"
go to the middle section there's about 45 criticals so we know there's points there,['Instruction'],[19]
yeah I think let's go to the map room,['Move'],[10]
D4 D4,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
high five,['0'],[0]
there's also,['0'],[0]
yeah because I C tool room spot with like something critical D4 and D3 and,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
there was a regular victim and H1 that you guys just walked by or that you guys are walking by the way there,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 13, 10, 2, 2]"
so yeah I was I'm privatizing like critical ones because they get like 50 points and five times regular one zone,"['CriticalVictim', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 2, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah I'm just marking,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah exactly I'll just leave them with like a tag on the floor right,['Plan'],[20]
say H1,"['Room', 'Instruction']","[3, 19]"
Phillippe,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
this was what type,['0'],[0]
a the one you just push a lever c b,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
common,['0'],[0]
we could go to E2 it's like close and I see some critical sight enter E2 open oh also it has Rubble so I need you,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Move', 'Rubble']","[1, 3, 3, 10, 10, 7]"
or maybe it's just one F2 like this Yeah Mmm Yeah,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
I think I can drop this one off because it has close,['Plan'],[20]
I'm right here,['ReportLocation'],[14]
I'll drop this one off like real quick is its close like two parts Zone C,['Plan'],[20]
Red Room,['0'],[0]
calm enter F4,"['Move', 'Room']","[10, 3]"
it's trapped can you clear the door while you're there,"['HelpRequest', 'YesNoQuestion']","[16, 18]"
medic but you are okay I will run this critical if you guys were here,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'ReportLocation']","[20, 6, 14]"
yeah F4 F4,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
just to your right,['0'],[0]
so we're here,['0'],[0]
yep medic I will take this critical,"['Plan', 'Medic']","[20, 6]"
critical is done and the other one is a Type A,['Victim'],[2]
let's move on to the left buildings the Seas,"['Instruction', 'Move']","[19, 10]"
because I believe the middle section is clear if all the Deeds are clear,['0'],[0]
yes and then,['Precedence'],[11]
you can go north through C8 or you can go down all the way to D1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Move']","[3, 3, 20, 20, 10, 10]"
North through C8,['Room'],[3]
and it kind of to go a little bit around auction in the wrong direction,['0'],[0]
oh,['0'],[0]
just to confirm you guys did not clear out M&L correct I don't pass that okay,['0'],[0]
this is okay,['0'],[0]
hey transporter like look back I'm dropping this for you this is a type a eight,"['Transporter', 'Victim']","[5, 2]"
you're going to C6,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay eh yeah eh,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
perfect I will grab that the next F2 guys are done with C6 head to C3,"['Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Room']","[3, 3, 20, 3]"
R B6 that works here,['Room'],[3]
perfect and I,['0'],[0]
let's go yeah yes car is nice this is nice,['Instruction'],[19]
points baby,['0'],[0]
150 points,['0'],[0]
go ahead and drop them out,['Instruction'],[19]
or cheese three critical,['0'],[0]
engineer yeah engineer there's Rubble at the door okay I'm here,"['Engineer', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[4, 4, 13, 7]"
okay you can pick this one almost here,['Plan'],[20]
yeah oh I think it's like intentional approach thing is is this like in C in the second picture you know,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
no well I guess for now yeah for now just use the marker Zone the floor,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
oh I guess yeah just use the markers for now,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
Library yeah now I'm lost,['0'],[0]
don't know Zone critical,['Instruction'],[19]
any chance you remember,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
coming,['0'],[0]
again like nice points,['0'],[0]
C3,['Room'],[3]
be sure to mark them,['0'],[0]
okay I have red C3,['Room'],[3]
yeah,['0'],[0]
this is a b b yeah,['0'],[0]
that's interesting,['0'],[0]
yeah I think we started with that right yeah,['0'],[0]
Barry's i2a was the top right have we gotten the bottom left corner of the map the,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
the ace over there,['0'],[0]
nothing here,['0'],[0]
okay let's go,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
okay nothing here probably inside the map search path icon,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
do they,['Instruction'],[19]
L4,['0'],[0]
there is a no it's a long stretch but at the very top right there's a critical that hasn't been done yet have we clear,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
M3 but I think M3 is a last,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
what about L3 all that stuff,['Room'],[3]
LL,['0'],[0]
M4 I believe oh,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
PSI c l 4 month will like,['0'],[0]
okay gosh we're missing a ton,['0'],[0]
okay found,['0'],[0]
we're still missing a lot of,['0'],[0]
critical here like in LA for I need somebody to like,['0'],[0]
for okay drop it out I'm on my way,['Move'],[10]
L3 own ice so L3 L4 both are like nice we need,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay and then,['Precedence'],[11]
okay I'm I'm coming to L4 first and B B NG medic,"['Medic', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 10, 18]"
gosh,['0'],[0]
I can't get in the door there you go,['0'],[0]
yeah okay this one and you can take this yeah,['Plan'],[20]

just leaving critical people around,['0'],[0]
okay Step 2 medic L3,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
yeah yeah B give you what is this it's a type c yeah it's a type c,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim']","[1, 1]"
no medic leave it leave it leave it leave it nope medic leave that that's critical commit,"['Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Medic', 'Medic']","[19, 19, 6, 6]"
mmm oh yeah this is also critical,['0'],[0]

oh I'm sorry we need to awaken,['0'],[0]
how do how do we relate how do we awaken,"['Question', 'Question']","[17, 17]"
yo why is nothing happening,['0'],[0]
two players must be within block,['0'],[0]
okay can you heal the yeah,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
yeah there's guys,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
what type of C,['0'],[0]
okay it's a type B B,['Victim'],[2]
okay oh you got it it's yours,['0'],[0]
okay okay B red B this guy's not like fiction,['0'],[0]
oh there we go you got them okay I will take both types these,['Plan'],[20]
oh he is oh no it's working yet,['0'],[0]
okay critical,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
oh gosh is there anywhere on the marker on the map that we haven't marked right,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
if E5 move,['Room'],[3]
oh that one was broken or not broken but C this one to this one is critical and it's not giving me points,['0'],[0]
I have two critical is that,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
I know like this this block I've put in all three rooms and I didn't get anything for it,['0'],[0]
okay we could hear oh my gosh I've nothing left I don't know what else to do,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah I got em checking all the regular now we just have regular people,['0'],[0]
that'll do,['Plan'],[20]
I'm just saying,['0'],[0]
time's up,['0'],[0]
get ready,['Instruction'],[19]
no inevitable death,['0'],[0]
here comes,['Move'],[10]
interesting,['0'],[0]
Zoom,['Instruction'],[19]
transporter I just finished as well,['Transporter'],[5]
this is the America just finished a certain way,['0'],[0]
engineer has no questions,['Engineer'],[4]
medic has no questions,['Medic'],[6]
no,['0'],[0]
medic is okay,['Medic'],[6]
engineer okay,['Engineer'],[4]
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm,['0'],[0]
so transported you want or do you all of you guys want to do is sweep like left-to-right basically transporter if you can just scan the rooms beforehand I think,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 20, 5]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I will say I don't think we're going to get to all of them and that's the point but I was given rooms with the most known damage which is more likely to have critical victims so the ones with the most damage or 1485 and C floor and,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 20, 13]"
C5 and C4 okay E5 and C4 both had meetings in them,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 9]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah so I think I should walk over to that area first to clear so I'm just going to go around clearing the known damage rooms,['0'],[0]
because I can't walk very fast,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
they're worth way more,['0'],[0]
maybe Whoever has like medic whenever he kill someone who can put them outside of the room just so it's easier for you to not have to navigate lunch of walls,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Meeting']","[20, 6, 9]"
yeah those are good suggestion so I can move them outside and then change the signs the labels,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 10, 11, 11]"
run around as much okay that sounds good,['0'],[0]
yeah I'm going to start I'm going to start in the A4 corner where there's the warning signs okay,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Plan']","[3, 20, 20]"
okay,['0'],[0]
A1 up down up to okay sounds good I will follow you then and I'll mostly focus on regular victims until you get some are until we find some more critical ones,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 1, 20, 20, 13, 11, 2, 2]"
I am so slow,['0'],[0]
right,['0'],[0]
critical,['0'],[0]
transporter if you're not far do you wanna help me with this A2 this is medic sorry,"['Room', 'Instruction', 'Medic', 'Transporter']","[3, 19, 6, 5]"
behind the rubble in A2,"['Room', 'Rubble']","[3, 7]"
brilliant do you want to take them now or do you want me to move them okay perfect and I'll change the sign,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18, 18]"
okay the others to there,['0'],[0]
that was a critical yeah,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
and I can move one of these just because B is right here,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
engineer I'm sorry just to check in where you're at,"['Engineer', 'Search']","[4, 15]"
I'm at B5 I clear the room Rubble here,"['Room', 'ReportLocation', 'Rubble']","[3, 14, 7]"
B5 okay,['Room'],[3]
sorry B where the,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
so there's like there's a bunch of victim think there's two victims in here two types,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[13, 2, 2]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
engineer could you clear the door for me at B A it got blocked,"['Engineer', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
this was an a victim and then there's a critical inside as well if you could come in,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[1, 13, 11, 2]"
okay yes,['0'],[0]
thank you and then I can move them outside the door is blocked again,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 10, 11, 11]"
every time,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
and then this was the critical victim clear C type there's also another critical victim right here engineer if you could,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Precedence']","[1, 1, 1, 4, 11]"
I'll just an actual firing,['0'],[0]
I can't heal while holding this interesting,['0'],[0]
I'll grab the critical one,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
okay perfect,['0'],[0]
there's no one else in here right,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
I didn't see one but I can double-check,['Plan'],[20]
the signal,['0'],[0]
no,['0'],[0]
no there's nothing there engineer this is medic could you clear the door,"['Engineer', 'Medic', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 6, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
Kate,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
while you do that I'm going to be moving some of the victims,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Victim']","[20, 10, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
and also I will change the labels on this left side,['Plan'],[20]
right,['0'],[0]
Green Room,['0'],[0]
some of the icon C which buildings are going to trap you K2 and j4 Rule,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
I can drop you,['Plan'],[20]
I'm actually going to ditch this,['Move'],[10]
are you going to pretty much all of them looks like,"['Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[15, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
sounds good I'm going to move to the right side then,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
which way are you going into I do,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
I'm not quite there yet but I will probably start on the I actually can't read what letter that is below M1,"['Plan', 'Room', 'ReportLocation']","[20, 3, 14]"
okay,['0'],[0]
so engineer if you want to actually come with me into this building and,"['Engineer', 'Move']","[4, 10]"
get the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'RescueInteractions']","[1, 19, 12]"
right I'm going to label that real quick,['Plan'],[20]
okay,['0'],[0]
there are there inside this room follow me think yeah,['Instruction'],[19]
perfect we can move them outside,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
okay,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
here here we're going to move that one,['0'],[0]
yeah I say the very bottom right room the blue one,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
actually let's move already the M1 because I want has a critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Move']","[1, 13, 3, 10]"
or not M1,['Room'],[3]
oh,['0'],[0]
okay okay A2 has is going to block you in so I can walk to that one with you so then I can get you okay,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[3, 20, 20, 11]"
I'm actually already locked in yeah,['0'],[0]
I'm on my way,['Move'],[10]
thank you,['0'],[0]
oh there's also a critical victim in here though,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
yeah that's why do you have,['0'],[0]
let me just set this down,['0'],[0]

yep,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
okay sounds good yeah if you want to run the critical victims may be first oops and then we'll just keep,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[20, 1, 20, 10, 11]"
don't be so we've gone to every room so we,['Move'],[10]
oh wait we should start labeling sorry I just realized,['0'],[0]
yeah SOS and then the ones in the top left outside of B8 are ready to be picked up as well transporter,"['Room', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[3, 11, 5]"
there's two victims in here,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
oh perfect okay,['0'],[0]
yeah I think so,['0'],[0]
what what type of victim was the first one that you did,['Victim'],[2]
that was a b,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
i can double-check actually maybe yeah here and then we can use the SOS perfect,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 11, 11]"
wait,['0'],[0]
means that their victims outside yeah,['Victim'],[2]
yeah,['0'],[0]
there's a I'm going to M1 now because you need another person medic,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Move']","[3, 6, 10]"

yeah,['0'],[0]
and then you said c is where the the gravel is,"['Precedence', 'Rubble']","[11, 7]"
I can walk over there over here,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
sure,['0'],[0]
we can delete one,['Plan'],[20]
okay I'm going to go to the other side does it j4 have two critical victim Zone we have four minutes left by the way so I think,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Room', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 20, 3, 10, 18]"
so I think let's just focus on the critical is then,"['CriticalVictim', 'Precedence']","[1, 11]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
and we should try to grab the people if they're not inside yet so transporter,['Transporter'],[5]
engineer could you clear j4,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 3, 18]"
j4,['Room'],[3]
yeah I'll go,['Plan'],[20]
I thought there was someone yeah there's two people in here,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
okay,['0'],[0]
both,['0'],[0]
do you need gravel clear adjust the person okay,"['Rubble', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[7, 2, 18]"
then all the way around behind here,['Precedence'],[11]
I can grab the other one yeah,['Plan'],[20]
thank you and then I left a b person thank you,"['Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[11, 11, 2]"
I got the gravel,['Rubble'],[7]
okay,['0'],[0]
engineer could you clear the rubble,"['Engineer', 'Rubble', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 7, 18]"
oh oh they're in here,['0'],[0]
oh there's two in here,['0'],[0]
other three in here okay,['0'],[0]
now there's three okay,['0'],[0]

I didn't know this is a rubble room right,"['ReportLocation', 'Rubble']","[14, 7]"
okay after the engineered finishes a help them move the stuff inside I think there's you pick up all the ones that were sitting outside,['Precedence'],[11]
okay their space now I'm putting them in,['0'],[0]
I'll open more of the rubble like Rubble,"['Plan', 'Rubble', 'Rubble']","[20, 7, 7]"
here we have 41 seconds left,['Move'],[10]
let's just do this H1,"['Room', 'Instruction']","[3, 19]"
oh wait did we clear this room,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]

I think we clear this one I'm sorry I think we forgot to remove the label,['0'],[0]
let's go there's two entrances,"['Instruction', 'Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[19, 19, 13]"
oh right,['0'],[0]
let me see if I can kill the person right here,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 2]"
easy 10 seconds,['0'],[0]
transport of the solute there type B,"['Transporter', 'Victim']","[5, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I don't think okay,['0'],[0]
ouch,['0'],[0]
oh tough,['0'],[0]
videos,['0'],[0]
engineer is dumb,['Engineer'],[4]
transporter complete,['Transporter'],[5]
and the medic is no complete,['Medic'],[6]
awesome thank you,['0'],[0]
the medic is back,['Medic'],[6]
where is here,['0'],[0]
transport is here,['Transporter'],[5]
look,['0'],[0]
transporter no questions,['Transporter'],[5]
medic no questions,['Medic'],[6]
engineer question,['Engineer'],[4]
I think our strategy was good last time I think this time it's just a matter of,['Plan'],[20]
doing it a little faster and keeping track of things a touch better,['0'],[0]
yeah we have C,['0'],[0]
hmm,['0'],[0]
I definitely am really slow but I'm also required to be like kind of following you I can tell you which rooms you shouldn't go in without me but like they're all the way across the map so when you enter them I'm going to have to walk across with you,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10, 20, 10]"
okay do you want to,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
let's try and keep the engineer from walking as much as little as possible,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Instruction']","[4, 19, 19]"
yeah I agree,['0'],[0]
but,['0'],[0]
I don't I'm not sure if that's possible,['0'],[0]
yeah just long distances,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
hmm,['0'],[0]
no I know but like let's try and keep you from yeah like going from point A to point B we just need to go from room the room the room kind of,"['Move', 'Move']","[10, 10]"
so for transporter you don't have to go into the room to see if there's someone in it right,"['Plan', 'Move', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Transporter']","[20, 10, 13, 5]"
yeah I can just walk by the whole thing by the door and,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
hmm,['0'],[0]
so I can I'll just go like I can just walk around like slowly across the map so we can move it I'm going back and forth,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 20, 20, 20, 10, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I think those,['0'],[0]
um so I have the list of I feel like a I feel like I should have paid attention to this more last time but I have the list of rooms with meetings and I think you have a list of rooms with a lot of damage and I think if we do like a Venn diagram of those rooms,"['Plan', 'Meeting']","[20, 9]"
I have a list,['0'],[0]
yes you said yours is meeting,['Meeting'],[9]
more people okay,['0'],[0]
yeah so there's like meetings in some of the rooms and I think those are the rooms with supposedly more victims yeah,"['Meeting', 'ReportLocation', 'Victim']","[9, 14, 2]"
I have to list of how many attendees and like we're at each meeting and then which meetings were canceled yeah,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence']","[9, 9, 11]"
oh,['0'],[0]
oh really oh sick okay I have A1 A4 B2 and B6 on the left side,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3]"
why doesn't,['0'],[0]
so B6 is severe,['Room'],[3]
and A1 and 881 and B2 or moderate damage the other my other rooms aren't the same,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
mine doesn't say Like A or B it just says two or more attendees and it will say,['Plan'],[20]
zoom2 meeting or faculty meeting,"['Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9]"
like Technic yellow say technical exchange meeting,['Meeting'],[9]
okay how many people are at that one,['0'],[0]

our,['0'],[0]
fine,['0'],[0]
Yeah and those critical victims as well,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
if I was going to A3 there's a lot of damage in there so I have to go in with them,"['Room', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move']","[3, 20, 13, 10]"
okay engineer this is medic you want to go with me to A3,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Move']","[3, 4, 6, 10]"
yeah I'm inside already there's two critical victims are there's a critical victim in here anyway so you know another person,"['CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 1, 13, 13]"
oh perfect okay,['0'],[0]
you're at A3,['Room'],[3]
yeah I am block the devil,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
let's start on this side,['Instruction'],[19]
then I can grab him up here,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
okay perfect,['0'],[0]
grab them and just put them outside don't even worry about move them,['Move'],[10]
yeah and you can do the other one,['Plan'],[20]
and then can you put down a placement marker engineer or an SOS marker,"['Engineer', 'MarkerBlock', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'MarkerBlock', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 8, 11, 11, 8, 18, 18]"
yeah I did that,['0'],[0]
come on,['0'],[0]
thank you is that the entire room,['0'],[0]

I think this room is clear,['0'],[0]
I'm gonna,['0'],[0]
Hall exam View,['0'],[0]
perfect okay,['0'],[0]
because it's the same room so if we don't enter twice B last,"['Plan', 'Move', 'ReportLocation']","[20, 10, 14]"
B2 is right here and it also has a critical can you clear this out,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 1, 18]"
I'll come in with you because I'm here here as well,['Plan'],[20]
you can grab the victim and put them outside I just want to see if there's anything in here,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 20, 2]"

there's nothing in here just a bunch of doors to nothing,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
oh very cool,['0'],[0]
sorry,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]

I said be careful medic whenever you're not near the engineer I'd say that's when you're likely to,"['Engineer', 'Medic']","[4, 6]"
yeah I'm I'm honestly transporting a couple of the critical ones right now,"['CriticalVictim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[1, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
just until engineer your back on this side or someone's back on this side so I can get the other critical Zone because there's a lot on this side,"['Engineer', 'Plan']","[4, 20]"
okay I'll be over,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
I'm almost done with my run around,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay I'm walking backwards the other side,['Move'],[10]
perfect,['0'],[0]

yeah,['0'],[0]
just very slowly um where do where should we go first,['Question'],[17]
okay there's,['0'],[0]
I was gonna go to C3 because there's a critical here,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move']","[3, 1, 13, 10]"
there's damage in there as well or did that C2,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 13, 13]"
okay,['0'],[0]

there's a lot of critical tools for on the right side,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
okay,['0'],[0]
I'll grab this guy when you're done,['Plan'],[20]
some sometimes the ground the come back,['0'],[0]
yeah have you guys been having to break blocks twice okay,['0'],[0]

okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
oh nice Jonah run all the way to the other side since there's more criticals there or,['Move'],[10]
yeah if you want to do like the i j hallway,['Plan'],[20]
transport if you want to grab the people on this side while we walk away other side,['Transporter'],[5]
yeah that's what I'm doing right now,['Plan'],[20]
perfect,['0'],[0]
okay cool and then when you get all of them then you can probably help faster than I can with the,"['Instruction', 'HelpRequest', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[19, 16, 20, 11, 11]"
I'm quickly out taste,['0'],[0]
oh,['0'],[0]
you're going to jail hallway right,['0'],[0]
yeah I just realized,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm on the wrong side that I wanted to be on sorry,['0'],[0]
sorry we can just go into here these ones won't door in storage C,"['Move', 'Plan']","[10, 20]"
there's a guy over here yeah,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
storage C I2,['Room'],[3]
I just saw a GPS signal,['0'],[0]
sorry,['0'],[0]
yeah I also lost GPS signal,['0'],[0]
further and further in yeah I lost GPS signal as well,['0'],[0]
okay so we're going to have to save them,['RescueInteractions'],[12]
gone blind,['0'],[0]
we can just we can just go down this hallway that we're currently because we already have everything written at least,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
that's it,['0'],[0]
so this one I'm going in with you i3,['Room'],[3]

okay perfect,['0'],[0]
then I'll grab him and you can get the other one,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 20, 11]"
yeah each one of these I'm having to break twice,['Plan'],[20]
I don't have that problem my sometimes the ground will come down again but,['0'],[0]
I'm going to skip this regular one for now because I think there's a lot of critical Zone the other side,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I'm getting the rubble there,['Rubble'],[7]
this one is one critical,['0'],[0]
middle coming in,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]

oh yeah cuz you can't C you need c stuff,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
I mean,['0'],[0]

how to make a get out,['0'],[0]
okay here it is oh my God okay,['0'],[0]
let's hear that yeah,['Instruction'],[19]

there's just one person at the top that's help the other side when we go to the middle,"['Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[19, 13, 2]"
well there is and there's one person at the very end yeah yeah I was gonna say let's go to the middle of the seems very far out of the way,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
I'm going to walk yeah I'm too slow,['Plan'],[20]
yeah,['0'],[0]
there's Zone in here you could probably do them by the time I get back to the middle,['0'],[0]

I think there's still a actually I can tell,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan']","[13, 20]"
sorry transporter,['Transporter'],[5]
which side I'm referring to,['0'],[0]
the a b side have you gotten those people those people medic and you,"['Medic', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 18]"
yeah I'm sorry I couldn't find you,['0'],[0]

okay,['0'],[0]
worth the most right now on,['0'],[0]
there's someone in here,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
I have three more,['0'],[0]
and then over here,['Precedence'],[11]
started two more criticals on a b side,['0'],[0]
there,['0'],[0]
I'm going to put them out here,['Plan'],[20]
this one's a problem,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]

yeah,['0'],[0]
I can't move I'm logging out,['0'],[0]
okay let's go boy the other way,['Instruction'],[19]
you're logging out okay,['0'],[0]

yeah there's one more critical up on by the m so,['0'],[0]
yeah but the top,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
that we couldn't we couldn't walk up to that one,['Move'],[10]

transporter is completed survey,['Transporter'],[5]
and here is completed,['0'],[0]
pass C what the hell's going on with my overlay,['0'],[0]
it would seem to be working,['0'],[0]
all right all right,['0'],[0]

before every sentence,['0'],[0]
please refer to your teammates with their respective Hall sight sight okay let's get ready formation one is the amount that the gravel will remain in Play Enter sight Zone building a database for two minutes you may use this time for discussions and then you can do yep all right over to you alright perfect so everybody can connect to server one again,"['Move', 'Instruction', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Rubble']","[10, 19, 20, 11, 11, 7]"
and same as before grab your tools by clicking on your role block,['0'],[0]
give me just a second,['0'],[0]
one more moment,['0'],[0]
okay so I have just been informed in response that question earlier about using things in chat in Minecraft we would like you to refrain from that if you okay so just just verbal communication and B marker blocks,"['Plan', 'MarkerBlock']","[20, 8]"
any last minute questions before we begin Mission 1,['0'],[0]
close transporter no questions,['Transporter'],[5]
okay it's transporter tool question great so just keep looking at that Rubble wall we're going to go ahead and start mission 1 in 5 4 3 2 1,"['Rubble', 'Transporter']","[7, 5]"
okay you got two minutes to discuss and then that wall will disappear,['Precedence'],[11]
okay so I dunno room engineer knows rooms with known damage and i4a E5 and C4 are most likely to have critical victims we also know M1 D2 and I2 are dangerous and likely to have critical victims and then possibly M3 B9 and a two,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room']","[13, 13, 3, 3, 11, 11, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3]"
okay so I dunno room engineer knows rooms with no damage i4a E5 C4 are most likely have critical victims we also know M1 E2 I2 are dangerous and like develop critical victims and then possibly M3 B9 agent,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room']","[13, 3, 3, 11, 11, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3]"
contact with ice transporter were what area did you guys want to start at fairs,['Transporter'],[5]
got it well as transporter were what area did you guys want to start at first,['Transporter'],[5]
so as medic I can see which meetings were meant to be happening today so which room is are being utilized by people and so I saw some overlap A2 C4 M3,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 3, 20, 6, 9]"
are all the ones that I heard overlaps but on the left side there's a K2 B9 and C4 in the middle there's D2 and E5 and on the right side there's I2 i4a and 1 M2 M3,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 13, 13, 13]"
okay,['0'],[0]
it looks like just you,['Search'],[15]
I'm not sure I might show me the same information I notice is that there's critical victims are likely to be an area the most severe damage we have like events so we have two or more attendees at a management meeting lunch a project meeting is it's just information that I'm getting are you guys seeing that to you,"['CriticalVictim', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[1, 9, 9, 9]"
that's yes I'm not sure what room is correlate with what,['0'],[0]
I'm not sure it will show me the same information I noticed that there's critical victims are likely to be there yet the most severe damage we have like event so we have two or more attendees at management meetings lunch project as it's just information I'm getting are you guys saying that to you it looks like just you actually yes I'm not sure what room is correlated with what if it seems like a makes up our information so,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Search']","[1, 20, 9, 9, 15]"
you should start on the left hand side probably push through C2 when deleted my color overlay from wherever it was and drive or we shall probably move,['Room'],[3]
it seems like a mix of our information so I think we should start on the left hand side probably push through C2 and a tour C4 and a two and then move through the other rooms that you have marked as meeting rooms,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 9, 10, 11, 11]"
that's good,['0'],[0]
yep so let's start with that I think it might be worthwhile for transport to just to run across all the rooms and mark them and I'll follow medic,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Transporter']","[20, 6, 5]"
sounds good,['0'],[0]
let's move up the C side first,['Instruction'],[19]

okay so A1 and A4 were canceled B2 and B6 and you said storage reorganization was also,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3]"
yeah so I think we should hit technical exchanges meeting lunch and management meetings first because they have two or more attendees in there,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
Asians on your screen yes storage reorganization was canceled in meeting was canceled zoom2 from Office canceled okay so A1 is A4 will cancel B2 + B6 and you said storage reorganization was also yeah so I think we should hit technical exchanges meeting lunch and management meetings first because they have two or more attendees away,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9]"
okay I say we work our way from left to right this time,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
because the left side is more like spread out and the right we can just kind of go down the hallway and see who is where,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Question']","[20, 10, 17]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay I say we work our way from left to right this time because the left side is more like spread out in the right we can just kind of go down the hallway and see who is there but keep in mind engineer cannot,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Move']","[4, 20, 10]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay well the meetings and A1 and A4 were cancelled B2 and B6 are still there D4 and F4 still have meetings and i2a and M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9]"
the room titles are meeting titles I can only see J2 M1 those numbers okay the meetings and floor will cancelled B2 and B6 are still there D4 and F4 still have meetings and i2a and M1 this is transponder I think medic and engineer system,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[20, 6, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3]"
this is transponder I think medic and engineer should stick together because you guys move a little bit slower and then I'll be easier for us to like do the two-person thing for critical,"['Engineer', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[4, 6, 11, 11, 2]"
together because you guys were a little bit slower and then it'd be easier for us to help you look for something critical,"['Precedence', 'Search']","[11, 15]"

okay sorry,['0'],[0]
I don't,['0'],[0]
yeah I think we are,['0'],[0]
okay this is engineer and I was given are we allowed to like give out our information that we have right okay so I was given out the rooms with known damage and I was also given information that says that critical victims are likely to be in the areas with the most severe damage so I do have rooms with severe moderate and Mild damage and then I also have the threat room flow K2,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 1, 4, 3, 11, 11]"
okay if you could share some of those threat rooms in a B I have information about the number of attendees and the different meetings but they'll it's like it's like two or more attendees management meeting lunch and then project meeting but I don't know what building I don't know what room is those are so,"['Precedence', 'Room', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence']","[11, 3, 18, 18, 20, 20, 20, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11]"
yeah project meeting is 14 a and then,"['Meeting', 'Precedence']","[9, 11]"
oh okay so project meeting is 14 a and the do you say lunch was one of them lunch is D2 and then Human Resources A2 so if,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 11, 18]"
ugh,['0'],[0]
okay so all three of those rooms are on my list the 14 a is in severe so I would say to go to that one first it is not too critical it's not critical and either,['0'],[0]
is I4 so you guys can go directly into their D2 is moderate so I would suggest that that would be the second one that you guys go to and that one is also not critical or not a threat room sorry and then A2 is mild,"['Room', 'Room', 'Move', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Room']","[3, 3, 10, 3, 20, 11, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay hold on that's a lot of information A2 has mild should we still try to do that thing where we like run through all them first I feel that's most efficient,"['Room', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 10, 18]"
yeah yeah I think so I think so maybe it will come up a go top of c a and like work our way through like that eyes in the Jays and then I kind of go through the middle at the end,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
okay so it do the A's sorry repeat that one more time just to make sure we got it,['0'],[0]
mmm,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
so go up through the a like the Agent B is on the left and go up through C8 because that's the connecting side and then go down on the right side where it's north Zone B,"['Room', 'Move', 'Move', 'Move', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11]"
okay I will say a A4 is a threat room,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Room']","[3, 20, 3]"
oh yeah,['0'],[0]
room,['0'],[0]
okay I'm gonna go ahead with a them okay I will I'm actually I'm not going to be actually going into any of the buildings I'm probably just going to be just leaving markers of where everything is if that's okay,"['Plan', 'MarkerBlock', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 8, 18]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah okay,['0'],[0]
so you guys it'll be easier on you guys because you guys don't have to worry about the threat room,['Room'],[3]
it's okay,['0'],[0]
I really do walk through,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
I'm just leaving a marker outside every single door so you guys know what's up,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
what are we here fire,['0'],[0]

oh yeah so,['0'],[0]
this is the engineer does your map still say that we have to head to M1,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 3, 10, 18]"
this is the medic and yes we have the I have the same,['Medic'],[6]
M1 still,['Room'],[3]
all right,['0'],[0]
same thing M1 M1 M3 and then we can go i4a and then I2,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 20, 20, 10, 11, 11, 11]"
all right according to the information I have M1 is some moderate room and M3 is mild in M1 we could find a victim Trouble game with critical damage,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Victim']","[3, 3, 3, 2]"
it says in mindful that two or more attendees and it has three bullet points that says management meeting lunch and project meeting so how do I know where those are,"['Question', 'Question', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[17, 17, 9, 9, 9]"
I thought they had an a,['0'],[0]
does it does it have the number and letter,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
no no little now letter,['0'],[0]
I thought they had answered your question on that,['0'],[0]
it's a door more attendees one attendees and canceled,['0'],[0]
let's just all go together do this,['Instruction'],[19]
yeah yes,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
I have the fastest walking speed so if need be I can run back and forth,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
yeah I think me meet the medic in the engineer we can tag team while you transport,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Medic']","[4, 20, 6]"
yeah sure,['0'],[0]
I'm just the engineer I have the slowest walking speed so it'll take me longer to get there,"['Plan', 'Engineer']","[20, 4]"
okay let's go,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
M1 right,['Room'],[3]
M1 yet,['Room'],[3]
M1,['Room'],[3]
since you're faster on the way you can probably check L1,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Search']","[3, 20, 15]"
L1 B is yeah I got it,['Room'],[3]
which is right but yeah,['0'],[0]
L1 regular victim,"['Room', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 2, 2]"
let me,['0'],[0]

Zone C is Zone C we have 1 minute so this is probably gonna be our last ones,['0'],[0]
yeah these will give us like a hundred points,"['Plan', 'Instruction']","[20, 19]"
let's see if my internet can get me there,"['Plan', 'Instruction']","[20, 19]"
yeah I think I think yeah just go to the Zone C,['0'],[0]
that's some B,['0'],[0]
this way this way to your left to your left,['0'],[0]
it's a good thing,['0'],[0]

that's okay,['0'],[0]
there's no other way,['0'],[0]
this right now did I did I die,['0'],[0]
no I can go through C8 correct,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move']","[3, 20, 10]"
no not yet to come to her,['Move'],[10]
C no come back come back that's the wrong way,['0'],[0]
B & a window,['0'],[0]

yeah we did it,['0'],[0]
is that enough today more alright,['0'],[0]
we're doing nice good job good job,['0'],[0]
well,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
and here,['0'],[0]
this is the transporter I'm ready,['Transporter'],[5]
engineer me too,['Engineer'],[4]
71 die,['0'],[0]
help,['0'],[0]
help,['0'],[0]
medic speaking and this time I think we should go left there's a lot of critical Zone the left side,['Medic'],[6]
first area of interest is the A1 section and then Ali C B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 right,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 11]"
Amaya,['0'],[0]
but the area is a hotspot yeah that area is a big hot spot for criticals and then finally we can choose to go A4 in the very top left or we can route to The Middle,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 20, 10, 11]"
is it a cluster of critical C anyway,['0'],[0]
die again,['Instruction'],[19]
this is a transporter is there a cluster of critical C anywhere else,['Transporter'],[5]
it just there let me check,"['Instruction', 'Search']","[19, 15]"
D4 for the middle F4 for the middle and then G3 the middle is kind of bad this time honestly,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 3, 3, 11]"
they're very spread out,['0'],[0]
this is the engineer speaking you said so you said A1 B1 and which other,"['Room', 'Room', 'Engineer']","[3, 3, 4]"
yes,['0'],[0]
no no it's the next speaking A1 and then you see the big cluster of b c B2 B3 B4 B5 B6,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 11, 14]"
yeah that's a big hot spot for critical and then at the very top left A4 has another one,"['Room', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[3, 10, 11]"
A1 all of these in A4 all right in my map 83 and I'm happy to say that A4 is mild,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3]"
so there will be damage there I think that's the place I should have first since its stated here that there's damage,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
this is it,['0'],[0]
this is the next meeting,['Meeting'],[9]
oh because I'm the slowest which place should I head to first so that I can start clearing up,"['Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 18]"
I think we should avoid A4 if there's damage because it's going to take a very long time for you to get back down,"['Room', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 20, 13]"
so A1 or A2 first okay,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
let's go A1 start there,"['Room', 'Instruction', 'Move']","[3, 19, 10]"
A1 then okay,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
yeah check out A2 I guess the i b probably only covered with,['Room'],[3]
nothing green A1 and A2 actually nothing in it too,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
nothing in a check again,['0'],[0]
this is engineer let me know which rooms have damaged so that so that I can straight go straight for them,"['Engineer', 'Plan']","[4, 20]"
A1 has no victims,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2]"
transport of B2 clear B3 clear and B4 no wait B 3 and b 4 clear not sure about B2,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Transporter']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 5]"

should I take the victim,"['Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[2, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I can handle it from now leave it to the transporter yeah,"['Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 5]"
our now you're too slow I think we should just forget the non critical guys,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
let's stay in a plan and stick with the Big B column here,"['Instruction', 'Plan']","[19, 20]"
all right,['0'],[0]
funny,['0'],[0]
just try opening up on to these rooms,['0'],[0]

this is transporter and done with the survey,['Transporter'],[5]

open up,['Instruction'],[19]

okay participants the one minute timer is up of these close that's like a fair die that means light,['0'],[0]
okay we are about to start issue 1 C reminder you are encouraged to meet or identification and sight,['0'],[0]
always start most of the beautiful for example if you are transported C is the friend smaller at the start of every please refer to your teammates with yellow expecting close actually okay let's get ready for one note that gravel role at the starting zone will be B in place for two minutes you may use this time for discussions if you wish,"['Plan', 'Rubble']","[20, 7]"
okay there's only one for me,['0'],[0]
I think it's not over,['0'],[0]
yes,['0'],[0]
so this is engineer in my critical Mission information I saw that it gave me we have severe moderate and Mild rooms and critical condition victims are likely to be in the severe room so I'm thinking we should Target the critical victims first to get the most points and then after that we can speed through and get um,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation', 'Victim']","[1, 20, 4, 20, 11, 11, 14, 2]"
the leftover victims that should give us the other points what do you guys think,['Victim'],[2]
that sounds good so does it tell you which rooms are which,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
it tells me which it has like so for example it says severe and it shows me three rooms those being i4a E5 C4 so it gives me three of the rooms not every room that would have a critical,"['Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 1, 3, 13]"
purse,['0'],[0]
wait you said i4a C4 and which other room,['Room'],[3]
E5,['Room'],[3]
B5 so those ones are more likely to be severe,['Room'],[3]
yeah those ones are severe damage rooms and those ones are going to be more likely to have the critical victims,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
pass,['0'],[0]
okay so this is the medic speaking I just got a list of rooms where meetings happen so I assume that these are the rooms that are most likely to have people and then so these are the rooms that we should check first C4 E5 and i4a were all included on that waste as well as A2 B9 D2 I2 M3 M1 but i-i have its we don't need to remember that but they're spread out,"['Room', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Search', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Medic']","[3, 9, 11, 15, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6]"
meetings at work by C so this is engineer I,"['Engineer', 'Meeting']","[4, 9]"
okay,['0'],[0]
notice you said M3 B9 A2 I2 those i c are mild and I2 is moderate so we could go down the list of severe to moderate to mild damage to get the I guess the most concentration of critical victims,"['Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3]"
so you said I2 is moderate,['Room'],[3]
what are them,['Question'],[17]
yes M3 is mild B9 is mild and A2 or mild,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
and,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
open for any information about D2 or M1,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
yeah D2 and M1 are moderate,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
transporter did you have any information,"['Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[5, 18]"
oh,['0'],[0]
yeah yeah so this is the transporter I have the types of meetings and how many attendees are at each door where at each management meeting lunch and project meeting had two or more attendees the facilities meeting security training Human Resources meeting,"['Transporter', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]"
had one attendee and the storage reorganization zoom2 meeting in zoom2 from office for canceled,['Meeting'],[9]
okay zoom2 from office has cancelled which other one was canceled,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
the storage reorganization and zoom,['0'],[0]
B medic which room,['Medic'],[6]
okay which this is medic which room had the most people,['Medic'],[6]
management meeting lunch and project meeting,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
and project we should yeah,['0'],[0]
mmm,['0'],[0]
so this is engineer room C4 this is one right really right in front of it says it's severe damage to this one should have a critical if we can get a medic to check,"['Room', 'Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'ReportLocation', 'Search']","[3, 20, 1, 4, 13, 20, 6, 14, 15]"
yes when is coming here to wake them up with me,['Move'],[10]
I'm gonna just take them outside the room and then the transporter can transfer friend too critical,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[20, 11, 11, 5]"
okay just remember to put down which type they are a b or c,['Question'],[17]
okay,['0'],[0]
I think we should head over after we're done with this to be the right side of the map this is the medic on the way because that has the most rooms that have,"['Medic', 'Precedence']","[6, 11]"
critical,['0'],[0]
yeah I agree,['0'],[0]
this is C this yeah that's critical,['0'],[0]
so so this is the transporter was this an a b or c victim okay,"['Transporter', 'Victim']","[5, 2]"
so I'm going to go into,['Plan'],[20]
pass,['0'],[0]
this is medic and I'm going to go into one does that sound good,"['Plan', 'Medic']","[20, 6]"
yeah I think so,['0'],[0]
yeah and then we just move our way forward through there okay M3 is a,"['Room', 'Precedence']","[3, 11]"
do you call it a threat room so I'll put down a sign there,"['Plan', 'Room', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 3, 18]"
okay,['0'],[0]
M1 has a lot of rubble in it,"['Room', 'Rubble']","[3, 7]"
okay I'm coming,['Move'],[10]
oh actually I just need you for to wake up Thursday become like common game,['0'],[0]
habit,['0'],[0]
okay and then I'm going to do,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
it's for transporter,['Transporter'],[5]
this is the medic should I go into M3 or will I get stuck in there or actually your room,"['HelpRequest', 'Move', 'Room', 'Medic', 'YesNoQuestion', 'YesNoQuestion']","[16, 10, 3, 6, 18, 18]"
you can go in and then I can clear out the way,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 20, 11, 11]"
is critical victim hands,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
a non critical victim,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
okay I'll help you out with the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan']","[1, 20]"
and then why don't you also grab the the non critical victim and then place them outside yeah there you go,"['CriticalVictim', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[1, 11, 11, 11]"
okay,['0'],[0]
let's make sure that they are separated so that we know who's who,"['Instruction', 'Question']","[19, 17]"
so let's go to i4a,['Instruction'],[19]
yeah that's another one of the severe ones,['0'],[0]
that's it,['0'],[0]
oh wow,['0'],[0]
what's up so like this gets weak B Street lunch first,['Meeting'],[9]
yeah there's a lot of critical here,['0'],[0]
I can come over here to wake them up,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
and then we,['Precedence'],[11]
this personality,['Victim'],[2]
you have to put what type that was the a b or c,['0'],[0]
but I think I did I put on my floor,['0'],[0]
can you come over here,"['Move', 'YesNoQuestion']","[10, 18]"
no it's yeah it's a critical sign it's not which type,"['CriticalVictim', 'Question']","[1, 17]"
bull critical is the same thing as C,['0'],[0]
okay sorry,['0'],[0]
yeah that works,['0'],[0]
so anytime and they're all going to be critical so I'm just going to place them all you can I'm good here so if you want to go ahead and find the Next Room,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Move']","[20, 20, 10]"
it's further said that the,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
I2 meeting was canceled so I don't know if we need to check,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Search']","[20, 3, 9, 15]"
B Tech,['0'],[0]
I3 didn't have anyone in it,['Room'],[3]
pass,['0'],[0]
Magic,['0'],[0]

here okay nevermind D2 is clear thank you,['Room'],[3]
this medic I just placed a,['Medic'],[6]
victim Cannon the South,['Victim'],[2]
hallway not sure what you call it then a victim so if you ever gone to the transporter,"['Move', 'Precedence', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[10, 11, 5, 2]"
this is engineer there's a critical victim and I believe that's A4 and there's a regular victim outside of a door marked it on the map there's also a threat zone here so when you come here just let me know and I'll clear out the way they are,"['Room', 'ReportLocation', 'Victim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Victim']","[3, 14, 2, 1, 20, 4, 13, 13, 10, 2]"
okay I think there is also a critical victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"

I don't know if it done son,['Plan'],[20]
all right question,['0'],[0]
all right one question,['0'],[0]
you are in a restaurant advisor so at the end of the survey work there are questions asking you to evaluate yet either,['0'],[0]
this is the make speaking do we know what score we got on their first mission,"['Instruction', 'YesNoQuestion']","[19, 18]"
oh yeah yeah,['0'],[0]
okay thank you,['0'],[0]
this is engineer I finished the survey,['Engineer'],[4]
and this is the transporter I also finished it,['Transporter'],[5]
stop,['Instruction'],[19]
okay yeah,['0'],[0]
all right question C button once again you will be provided with a one minute,['0'],[0]
okay please wait for my go signal before you can put C the next slide you have one minute to look through the sight please do not talk or discuss during this time you may proceed to the next slide in 3 2 1 go,"['Instruction', 'Plan']","[19, 20]"
okay participants is up close B and admin please verify that sight approach,['Instruction'],[19]
Yep they're close Okay as a reminder you are encouraged to your teammates green commission or identification and severe severe weather service has always artists and M2 b b Hall sight for example if you are the engineer save this at the start of every these reported in A2 b b are inspected for signs okay let's get rid of this partition experience please note C that,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Room']","[3, 20, 4, 3]"
this is medic enter the engineer pass partnership from severe most people,"['Engineer', 'Move', 'Medic']","[4, 10, 6]"
okay this is medic I think that the engineer and transporter should go from most severe and most people to least when we talk about this right now,"['Engineer', 'Medic', 'Transporter']","[4, 6, 5]"
so we can decide which room is the most important,['Plan'],[20]
this is engineer I have the same thing same report severe is i2a G3 B6 what I was thinking is since we know G3,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 4, 3, 3]"
another severe damage rooms and that little area with the brown like rooms it seems like the most densely packed we could try go there first and then move outward to the Green Building with i2a,"['Move', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[10, 10, 11, 11]"
okay sounds good transporter what,['Transporter'],[5]
what meetings had the most people in them,['Meeting'],[9]
okay this is the transporter B technical exchange meeting lunch and management meeting have two or more attendees and the IT training facilities meeting and Human Resources meeting only had one,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Transporter']","[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5]"
this is medic can you repeat the third meeting that had two or more people you said taking close change lunch and what else,"['Medic', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'YesNoQuestion']","[6, 9, 9, 18]"
management,['0'],[0]
office medic here K2 B,"['Room', 'Medic']","[3, 6]"
there's room on management meeting okay,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Meeting']","[13, 9]"
so that is B6 is the technical exchange meeting so that's an important one F4 and D4 so I agree with the engineer we should start in the middle section and then maybe move out transporter where any meetings canceled,"['ReportLocation', 'ReportLocation', 'Transporter', 'Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[14, 14, 5, 3, 3, 4, 3, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11]"
so that is B6 if I can click change meetings that F4 and D4 so I3 engineer since starting the middle section for the remaining agents cancelled,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Meeting', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 20, 3, 4, 3, 3, 20, 9, 14]"
yes,['0'],[0]
yes the storage reorganization the zoom meeting and the zoom2 from office,['Meeting'],[9]
A1 A4 D3 of maybe maybe D3 people die,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3]"
okay so that is A1 A4 and G3 so maybe maybe G3 is not going to many people but I still think that we should,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 14]"
okay,['0'],[0]
this is engineer you guys said that the meetings that had two more people were in B6 B6 is a severe location so that will have a critical person most likely B2 is moderate I believe and D4 was mild so we probably want to hit up B6 if we want critical and we know that had a meeting with two or more people if you guys are okay with that,"['Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 20, 1, 3, 20, 4, 13]"
that's a great this is medic after we get B6 I okay and after this transporter can you go through like some of the buildings,"['Room', 'Plan', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Transporter', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 20, 6, 11, 11, 5, 18]"

this is engineer I finished the survey,['Engineer'],[4]
this is medic I finished survey,['Medic'],[6]
hi this is engineer and I have I know the damage of each room and I think what I want the plan to B is I can tell you guys which rooms are most severe which ones are more moderate and which ones are mild,"['Engineer', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 20, 20, 18]"
this is transport I have a minimum of nine people,['Transporter'],[5]
and it confirmed locations I can give you guys though,['Plan'],[20]

and this is engineer do we want to make a plan for where we go first and how we stick together,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Question', 'Plan', 'YesNoQuestion']","[4, 19, 17, 20, 18]"
this is medic,['Medic'],[6]
honestly what seemed to be working best last time when we just did like the intro one was transported are going ahead marking room is whether they have a victim or they don't have victim I think if you kind of go ahead and label all that and made it easy for engineer and I it's a go through and he went around cleared Rubble if there was rubble and then if there was a critical victim he was able to help me,"['Plan', 'Rubble', 'Rubble', 'Victim', 'Victim', 'Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence']","[20, 7, 7, 2, 2, 20, 1, 4, 19, 13, 13, 13, 13, 11]"
and then I will be happy to bring the victims into like the main Halls like I did last time,"['Precedence', 'Victim']","[11, 2]"
this is transport I'm on board with doing that I'll go off to the farthest reach from where we are and label eyes I go medic if you can just as you're removing people Mark the rooms as empty but I would be I'd be most helpful,"['Plan', 'Question', 'Medic', 'Move', 'Transporter']","[20, 17, 6, 10, 5]"

this is transport to Tech I just fell out of it,['Transporter'],[5]
yeah this is medic I also have fun,['Medic'],[6]
all right this is engineer I do want to say feel free to disagree with my suggestions but I think we should when we go into buildings we should move all the the,"['Engineer', 'Move']","[4, 10]"
victims out and have them in grouped up in designated areas around the different parts of the map and also I think that we need to focus on more heavily populated areas because we didn't have a lot of time last time and if I recommend if you're going to a new letter for example J let me know you're going into,"['Plan', 'Victim']","[20, 2]"
the J column and I'll tell you if there's any threat zones there and I don't think we should even bother entering threat zones unless I'm right next to you guys or we don't have any other options what do you guys think,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Move']","[20, 20, 10]"
this is medic a lot that sounds good the designated areas I don't know if like we like room I don't know if you meant like grouping them up by like their letter or what but like all what I think was working best is I'll just bring them into like the main hall Zone the North and the South and make sure I Mark the victims and then also a thought I had was last time engineering I went left and transported went right I think we should just follow the,"['Victim', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Engineer', 'Medic', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[2, 20, 20, 4, 6, 11, 11]"
transporter and sure like the first room we'll all be there but the transporter is so quick that the transporter will be able to start marking rooms ahead of us and I think it will be good for us to kind of follow the path of C the transporter instead of splitting up,"['Transporter', 'Transporter', 'Transporter', 'Transporter']","[5, 5, 5, 5]"
this is,['0'],[0]
this is engineer sorry and I agree with that and I think that transporter should also maybe stay a little closer to us and start cleaning up the victims and transporting them sooner than marking every single room,"['Engineer', 'Transporter', 'Victim']","[4, 5, 2]"
this is transport I was going to suggest that we take victims out of rooms or that I take victims that are in a regular State and leave them on the South Hall,"['Transporter', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[5, 2, 2]"
do you agree,['YesNoQuestion'],[18]
this is engineer I agree maybe not always the South Hall though maybe also the North Hall whichever ones closer,['Engineer'],[4]

this is the engineer there I've got a list of rooms with known damage severe damage is going to be i4a E5 and C4 those are going to be most likely to have critical victims in them and then we've got M1 D2 and I2 with moderate damage and then M3 B9 and A2 with mild damage it looks like there's also a critical threat rooms all over,"['Room', 'Room', 'Engineer', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Room', 'Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Room', 'Search', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room']","[3, 3, 4, 3, 13, 13, 3, 3, 11, 11, 11, 3, 15, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3]"
what A4 B8 C2 D3 h1a j4 and K2 and M3 as well,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]"
okay this is the medic so in half the rooms you named there's actually meetings going on so I2 i4a M1 M3 are the meetings happening on the right side of the map D2 and E5 are the meetings happening in the middle and then A2 B9 and C4 other ones happening on the lever so I'm assuming there's going to be a couple more victims than just one in those rooms and then considering the severe damage ones this was going to be a bunch of critical victims in those,"['Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Medic', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Plan', 'Room']","[3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 11, 11, 11, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 20, 20, 3]"
certain rooms,['0'],[0]
yep that's right,['0'],[0]
makes a lot of sense so you said i4a was one of them correct the meeting rooms E5 was that one of them,"['Room', 'Meeting']","[3, 9]"
E5 is yep that's one of the middle,['Room'],[3]
and then C 4,['Precedence'],[11]
C4 yep that's in the low side,['Room'],[3]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay so probably definitely want to look at those ones as soon as we can because you're probably right those will probably have the most critical victims,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan']","[1, 20, 13, 20]"
blue,['0'],[0]
so if we're coming into the middle C said E5 was one with the severe damage,['Room'],[3]
yes,['0'],[0]
okay then let's just go straight for E5 up to start and then see how many we can,"['Room', 'Instruction', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 19, 11, 11, 11]"
get from there and bring them back,['Instruction'],[19]
this is the transporter I don't have any room numbers but I have where people are attending so management meeting lunch and project meeting have two or more attendees so I just have a list of how many people are in like certain areas and then where there's no people yeah so,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Transporter']","[9, 9, 9, 11, 5]"
okay I C police know project meeting you said project meeting right,"['Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9]"
yeah project meeting is two or more people,['Meeting'],[9]
okay so i4a is on the right side it let's go to E5 then C if you can clear that out first,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[20, 3, 20, 10, 11]"
move this,"['Instruction', 'Move']","[19, 10]"
yeah if I there's a bunch of rubble in the way,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[13, 7]"
E3 critical victim,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room']","[1, 3]"
if F3 no one A4 no one,"['Room', 'Room', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 3, 2, 2]"
E5 no one,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
E4 Nan,['Room'],[3]
all we found okay,['0'],[0]
so E3 is the only one people I know,['Room'],[3]
E3,['Room'],[3]
okay then,['Precedence'],[11]
yes engineer if you could just clear up the rubble so you could get the guy out I'll check these Doors Down Here,"['Plan', 'Engineer', 'Rubble', 'Search']","[20, 4, 7, 15]"
wake me up hey so this is a type c transporter if you want to grab this one I'll bring them to you,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Transporter']","[1, 20, 5]"
Pepsi,['0'],[0]
another free,['0'],[0]
rest of the ease look clear correct,['Instruction'],[19]
all right I'll be back yeah,['0'],[0]
yep everything should be good,['0'],[0]
all right let's i4a is right actually,['Instruction'],[19]
yeah let's close this,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
yeah we'd have to go round to get to that one you want to just take check the H2 rezendes on the way here I'm not sure this engineer here but,"['Engineer', 'Room']","[4, 3]"
yes at the H2,['Room'],[3]
country,['0'],[0]
yeah everything's good H2,['Room'],[3]
checking is,['0'],[0]
I guess I think we have the whole oh yeah H2 is clear so I think we have all of H2 and the building is clear so,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
is H2 storage,['Room'],[3]
it's a kitchen I believe that's all,['0'],[0]
I channeled I don't have information on people in that area,['0'],[0]
yep,['0'],[0]
oh yeah C critical victim over here engineer if you want to come home again yeah lot of rubble in the window,"['CriticalVictim', 'Engineer', 'Rubble']","[1, 4, 7]"
okay,['0'],[0]
I was transported I found a regular guy and G3,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2]"
okay,['0'],[0]
okay so that one's type c engineer,"['CriticalVictim', 'Engineer']","[1, 4]"
there's also Rubble as well,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[13, 7]"
wow,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
oh yeah the rebels come back okay you're gonna have to put him down and then yeah here I'm going to do the critical,"['CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Rubble']","[1, 20, 11, 7]"
there we go,['Move'],[10]
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah where are you guys I lost track of you,['0'],[0]
we are in H1 right now,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
H1,['Room'],[3]
we're taking thinking B comes back to their respective room zone now,['0'],[0]
i c,['0'],[0]
two A1 regular one critical,"['Room', 'Victim']","[3, 2]"
okay engineer going to come with me we can clear out these D rooms I'm right behind you,"['Engineer', 'Plan']","[4, 20]"
okay yep,['0'],[0]
yep oh to victim Zone here okay,['Victim'],[2]
any clear up need done,['0'],[0]
none in here,['0'],[0]
we're on our way that's slightly sidetracked and I found some guys in the DJ's own,['0'],[0]
hey baby,['0'],[0]
hey,['0'],[0]
which room are the ah there you go,['0'],[0]
D2 is clear,['Room'],[3]
I've already got them,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
I have the victim Zone timed up over there you can see them it's okay engineer floor to come in here with me D3 those are critical need some of the Wake move,"['Room', 'Engineer', 'Plan', 'ReportLocation', 'Victim']","[3, 4, 20, 14, 2]"
oh oh oh it's a threat room,"['ReportLocation', 'Room']","[14, 3]"
clear out all we can for you,['0'],[0]
search,['0'],[0]
if you want to take him,['0'],[0]
there's another one here so I'm going to grab this one if you could get the critical to the B,"['Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'Plan', 'RescueInteractions']","[20, 1, 20, 12]"
clear so the one you have is critical yep,['0'],[0]
okay this is B of the toggle player for you,['0'],[0]
hey pass me that was a b this drop the B B I can drop this guy C and then run to B,"['Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 11]"
thank you,['0'],[0]
okay so we've cleared out all these rooms I'm saying,['0'],[0]
yeah D4 is clear as well there is a door in here going somewhere though we double-check it,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 13]"
we are going to go chat,['Plan'],[20]
he's going to die,['0'],[0]
okay yeah that's just going to hallway so that's clear,['Move'],[10]
perfect,['0'],[0]
I'm going to start at looking into C rooms,['Plan'],[20]
no okay,['0'],[0]
found a critical victim in C 2,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
all right here I'm right here with you and wake them up,['ReportLocation'],[14]
I'll wake him up for you,['Plan'],[20]
I'm not sure if it's a threat room oh yeah,"['ReportLocation', 'Room']","[14, 3]"
yeah there's a bunch of rubble in the world,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[13, 7]"
there's two victim Zone icon this guy and can reach the window,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[13, 2]"
can't move yeah,['0'],[0]
also this is a b,['0'],[0]
so B and C are in the B,['0'],[0]
this is,['0'],[0]
wait wasn't wouldn't that be a c cuz he was critical,['0'],[0]
oh gotcha gosh okay,['0'],[0]
the one I have is a c type there's a distance critical or I'm going the wrong way,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
oh no the wasn't my bad,['0'],[0]
oh yeah we could we could just move all the victims before stabilizing them into the B room and then I can just do them all at the end if you think that would be quicker,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 10, 11, 11, 2]"
C3 is clear,['Room'],[3]
because you do have a lot of speed so if you bring all the victims into one area I can just go through and then check all of them,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Search', 'Victim']","[20, 20, 11, 11, 15, 2]"
yeah that is a good point yeah,['0'],[0]
engineer,['Engineer'],[4]
true yeah the only thing that worries me is a threat rooms because that would just take time up here but yeah I'll go ahead and start checking for victims,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Victim']","[20, 3, 2]"
oh there's a lot of rubble here so I have no idea there's a victim inside,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble', 'Victim']","[13, 13, 7, 2]"
what's your name,['Question'],[17]
okay,['0'],[0]
C5,['Room'],[3]
and I mean C4 C4 there is a critical victim,"['Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 3, 1, 13]"
yeah I'm in the room right next to you okay here I'm coming to you,['Move'],[10]
I found a critical victim and a two,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
you for to wake them up there we go,['0'],[0]
there we go,['Move'],[10]
on my way,['Move'],[10]
hey if you just check C5 for me I have no idea what's going on,"['Room', 'Search']","[3, 15]"
this is a c i put a tag on the map for your transporter if you can come grab C whenever you can,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Transporter']","[20, 20, 5]"
C4,['Room'],[3]
C5 Red Dot C5 there's a critical victim Zone on,"['Room', 'Room', 'CriticalVictim']","[3, 3, 1]"
B5 on my way,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
C5 is clear,['Room'],[3]
perfect,['0'],[0]
check C6,['Room'],[3]
yep screams clear too,['0'],[0]
so,['0'],[0]
clear,['0'],[0]
meaning attacking whether victims there's a over by A1 and A to B there's some victims that haven't been dealt with,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2, 2]"
okay okay let's just finish all this C rooms there's only two more and then we can go work on those ones,"['Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[19, 13, 20, 11]"
oh I hear a sound fire Maybe,['0'],[0]
yeah there's fire,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
so we do have rooms on the other side of the map so we don't have to always go back to the you know,['0'],[0]
floor side the does an a zone right here,['0'],[0]
great there's only the one victim outside of C3 right,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 2]"
C it's cleared,['0'],[0]
C wake It Go,['Instruction'],[19]
okay Pi enter Zone E1 and others to victim Zone here let's wake him up,"['Room', 'Move', 'Victim']","[3, 10, 2]"
so here you got the C and then this guy's a so he's right here I can just drop them off,"['Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'ReportLocation']","[20, 11, 11, 14]"
say oh this was a threat room,"['Instruction', 'ReportLocation', 'Room']","[19, 14, 3]"
Witcher,['0'],[0]
yeah,['0'],[0]
oh yeah except okay and you were stuck in B9,"['HelpRequest', 'Room']","[16, 3]"
yay,['0'],[0]
B9 on my way,"['Room', 'Move']","[3, 10]"
it's B8,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
it just looks a little weird,['Search'],[15]
oh it's a beauty oh no it is it is it is yeah my Red Dot shows yeah,['0'],[0]
sorry,['0'],[0]
the guy you're holding is an a medic,['Medic'],[6]
yeah you know stabilize I'm over here,['0'],[0]
perfect,['0'],[0]
all right just replace the floor marker so we don't mistake it,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
okay yeah and B just drop off a,['Instruction'],[19]
but there's a c zone right here actually,['0'],[0]
yes we don't have to go all the way back now for the player,['0'],[0]
two regular victim Zin,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
oh there's a there's a ton of not you go,['0'],[0]
B7,['Room'],[3]
yeah I'm here putting them off,['0'],[0]
really oh no proble by the northern C zone so I can't take him there,['0'],[0]
I want to go the long way,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
ah okay both C Zone ones are blocked,['0'],[0]
on my way,['Move'],[10]
oh I'm stuck again and you could come back yeah B8 yeah I'ma put Red Zone Zone this room so we don't go back in here,"['HelpRequest', 'Room']","[16, 3]"
I thought the critical victim down next to it we have to clear these zones for the victims,"['CriticalVictim', 'Victim']","[1, 2]"
right behind you engineer just walked past me,['0'],[0]
which room are you s,['0'],[0]
I've b a b a,['0'],[0]
b a okay,['0'],[0]
B,['0'],[0]
gotcha,['0'],[0]
all right that's a b victim right there,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
the victim can you stabilize a medic,"['Plan', 'Medic', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[20, 6, 2, 18]"
yeah I'm coming over,['Move'],[10]
have to get the C Zone Zone unblocked soon,['0'],[0]
okay yeah then enter if you want to go do that then really quickly,"['Plan', 'Move', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[20, 10, 11, 11]"
which which area am I looking at for that,"['Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[15, 18]"
South Zone C,['0'],[0]
South Zone C okay on my way over there,['Move'],[10]
this is a green icon,['0'],[0]
medic and you come over to A2,"['Room', 'Medic', 'Move']","[3, 6, 10]"
which one,['0'],[0]
yep I'm on my room oh I think it's the threat room I'm stuck in here again there's a different room,"['HelpRequest', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'ReportLocation', 'ReportLocation', 'Room']","[16, 13, 14, 14, 3]"
A4 I see it,['Room'],[3]
I have no idea,['0'],[0]
I came in here and let me help you help me heal him for you can just take them out,"['Instruction', 'RescueInteractions']","[19, 12]"
that's the type A that's the type A yep,"['Victim', 'Victim']","[2, 2]"
I'm on my way over to get you out,['Move'],[10]
all right type A all right is right here,['Victim'],[2]
thank you sir yeah I'm just going to drop a load of a threat tags on the rooms that are threads,['0'],[0]
oh nice enough,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
all right I'm going to go back and start clearing out Zone C again,"['Plan', 'Plan']","[20, 20]"
and this one's clear,['0'],[0]
A2 B There is some guy here,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[3, 13]"
okay this is,['0'],[0]
I just need some to wake him,['0'],[0]
Isabel is clear now,['0'],[0]
blue marker,['MarkerBlock'],[8]
I got you,['0'],[0]
and then there are two victims by A1 if you just kill them right up I wish I was a critical yet so I just got to leave the next to the other one,"['Room', 'Plan', 'CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence', 'Victim']","[3, 20, 1, 13, 11, 2]"
whether OU labeled it great thank you,['0'],[0]
okay so one of those at a time,['0'],[0]
and it,['0'],[0]
okay,['0'],[0]
and this room is clear,['0'],[0]
let's not some C gun,['Instruction'],[19]
decorate like I just start firing move you get done,['0'],[0]
all right Zone C area is cleared out,['0'],[0]
if you want while you're right here could you just empty up G3 or empty the bowl there because there's a victim,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 13, 2, 18]"
yeah I'm on my way to you guys right now,['Move'],[10]
gee sorry was that G3,['Room'],[3]
G3 B right below North Zone C,['Room'],[3]
okay,['0'],[0]
okay so we still have another 10 critical victims I say we try and help those ones first,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
this is a type of a,['Victim'],[2]
two of them are on standby there's I think the I4 j4,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay we can do that next,['Plan'],[20]
have a lot of critical victims because yeah,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing']","[1, 13]"
we cleared out the entire c section right,['0'],[0]
yeah let's destroy open map,['Instruction'],[19]
all right I'll take the 12 Zone B,['Plan'],[20]
okay and I'll take a,['Plan'],[20]
is this way,['0'],[0]
okay C and B is B Block off,['0'],[0]
oh no I think he grabbed up B already engineer die B already,['Engineer'],[4]
if you drop B all right I hear they're pretty much out here yeah I will check I4,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Search']","[20, 3, 15]"
okay let's go,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
yeah it's there's Rubble,"['Instruction', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Rubble']","[19, 13, 7]"
yeah and then I'll head over to I4 because we know that there was a big deal there,"['Plan', 'Room', 'Move', 'Precedence']","[20, 3, 10, 11]"
yeah there's a project meeting and so there's probably a bunch of people considering the severe damage as well,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Meeting']","[13, 9]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
yep I'm right here three critical Zone okay let me just wait them all up,['0'],[0]
he's not waking up,['0'],[0]
oh the medic has to be here oh there's the really critical victims all great i3,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Medic']","[1, 3, 13, 6]"
I think the medic has to be there while we're waking him up or something right,['Medic'],[6]
oh I'm here,['0'],[0]
maybe if I leave the room maybe it's because there's so many people,['Move'],[10]
yeah why is that not working,['0'],[0]
hey girl hey,['0'],[0]
yeah sending 200 yes I think it's if there's too many people that's what it is,['Plan'],[20]
perfect,['0'],[0]
let me stand next to you yeah he's up,['0'],[0]
alright taking him to C,['0'],[0]
he's open to help okay yeah that's all grab one and yeah,['0'],[0]
just leave them outside the door you just leave them outside the door and I'll fire him over,['Plan'],[20]
will do so yeah those should all be seized,['0'],[0]
j4 is the other one,['Room'],[3]
yeah I left the tags just in case okay okay so doesn't I2 doesn't meeting going on and I2 of engineer unit come with me for the,"['Engineer', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[4, 3, 3, 9]"
yeah,['0'],[0]
did you guys check j4,"['Room', 'Search', 'YesNoQuestion']","[3, 15, 18]"
okay this is all blocked off but,['0'],[0]
you're saying it's clear okay yeah engineer here just check this room,"['Engineer', 'Instruction', 'Search']","[4, 19, 15]"
j4,['Room'],[3]
so J j4 there's a there's a critical victim in here and a regular one,"['CriticalVictim', 'Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[1, 3, 13, 2]"
okay let's go wake him up,['Instruction'],[19]
I think we're out of time,['0'],[0]
oh yeah we had about 10 seconds,['0'],[0]
duh,['0'],[0]
what was the regular victim,"['Question', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[17, 2, 2]"
yeah you guys run those over,"['Instruction', 'Move']","[19, 10]"
question b c,['0'],[0]
oh,['0'],[0]
nice,['0'],[0]
dang it oops,['0'],[0]
all right I just guessed you as a b oh nice,['0'],[0]
thank you,['0'],[0]
is the transporter and I'm back,['Transporter'],[5]
Ambiance is America,['0'],[0]
does the engineer I'm back as well,['Engineer'],[4]
this is the engineer I'm ready,['Engineer'],[4]
transporter is ready,['Transporter'],[5]
map,['0'],[0]
all right so this time I think it might be better if we go for whatever the severe rooms are that have other things going on so for severe damage rooms I have i2a G3 and B6 do those match any of your guys's like high-traffic places,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
oh yeah it's good point,['0'],[0]
yes it but the thing is all three of those rooms that you just named are on each of their own sections for the time it's going to take for us to go to each one is probably going to use the whole 15 minutes so we have so B yeah because meetings on the left side you have A1 A4 B2 B6 meetings in the middle you have D4 F4 G3 and the meetings on the right side you have i2a and M1,"['Room', 'Room', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room']","[3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]"
so the three severe damage once you named are all on there they're all in their own like each section,['0'],[0]
yeah that's a good point,['0'],[0]
aunt,['0'],[0]
yeah I don't have like prefixes for the room was all I have are technical exchange meetings lunch and the management meeting which is,"['Meeting', 'Meeting', 'Meeting']","[9, 9, 9]"
B 6,['0'],[0]
so well the so on my information the left side is what has four meetings going on it's the most out of all three and you said severe damage rooms were B2 or B6 which almost like B6 okay so I say considering that this for meeting is going on in the left side we just go to the left side straight away and then try and clear up B6,"['Meeting', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Room', 'Meeting']","[9, 11, 11, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9]"
okay so b line to B6 to begin and then clear out the left side after that,"['Room', 'Precedence', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[3, 11, 11, 11]"
yeah I think that's the best way to do and we have a Zone a at the top Zone B at the bottom in the nominee c c in the middle so we can split with way we need to go yeah,['Plan'],[20]
Ferry them either way yeah agreed that makes sense,['0'],[0]
all right,['0'],[0]
okay let's go boys come on SO severe damage by the way um those three rooms are the only ones you have for severe damage,"['Instruction', 'Instruction']","[19, 19]"
okay,['0'],[0]
yeah just those three just i2a G3 and B6 so we can,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
sorry,['0'],[0]
I might be able to just run into them I was going to say because I was able to mark out the entire I section before quickly so I might be able to just run across and broke,['0'],[0]
yeah you close you are a lot faster than as you're okay,['0'],[0]
so I'll start off with you guys with the sets and then after we do a sweep of the left side I can probably just run down the I and J section,"['Plan', 'Plan', 'Precedence']","[20, 20, 11]"
and I'll just start marking things,['Plan'],[20]
yes I'm B6 is completely blocked off with a robot,"['Room', 'ReportLocation']","[3, 14]"
engineer Zone his way,['Engineer'],[4]
Rubble tool,['Rubble'],[7]
lot of critical victims there,['CriticalVictim'],[1]
it's clear amount oh yeah three okay,['0'],[0]
blue,['0'],[0]
this is insane both of these protocol,['0'],[0]
all three of them are critical,['0'],[0]
if you want to put the correct one to decide I can pick them up on my way back,"['Plan', 'Move']","[20, 10]"
yeah I'll put them,['Plan'],[20]

did ya D4 is a threat room so,"['Room', 'Room']","[3, 3]"
okay,['0'],[0]
that's a b room there's a critical victim in this room and then a regular one adjacent,"['CriticalVictim', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Precedence', 'Victim', 'ReportLocation']","[1, 13, 11, 2, 14]"
yeah so this is a this is a type B let me put the marker down let me wake this up there we go,"['MarkerBlock', 'Victim']","[8, 2]"
all right all right him down to C,['0'],[0]
there's no more victims in here left just took a little move through regular ones,"['KnowledgeSharing', 'Move', 'Victim', 'Victim']","[13, 10, 2, 2]"

yeah there's there's a ton of guys over here,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
I'm just hoping that none of these are threat rooms,['Room'],[3]
the critical Zone here okay here you need to start helping me wake them up and then we can move them yeah that is a very good point,"['CriticalVictim', 'Instruction', 'Instruction', 'Plan', 'Precedence', 'Precedence']","[1, 19, 19, 20, 11, 11]"
because last time I sort of messed up stuff of it,['0'],[0]

critical in here but Rubble in the way oh no it's not,['Rubble'],[7]
okay,['0'],[0]
there is also a H1 it's like right before there's no regular guy in die,"['Room', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'KnowledgeSharing', 'Victim']","[3, 13, 13, 2]"

yeah,['0'],[0]
oh this is a threat room gets a blue,"['ReportLocation', 'Room']","[14, 3]"
ranged outfit oh there's two guys in here nowadays,['KnowledgeSharing'],[13]
