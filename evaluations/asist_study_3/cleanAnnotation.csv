this is medic I just fell to my death all right,Medic,[6]
this is medic do you guys have any any feedback for the last session,Medic/Question{topic:{feedback form last session}},"[6, 17]"
this is my room what we could do is start on a and then work all the way around the perimeter through Shea and L and then finish through dnf,"Room/Precedence{first:{start on},second:{work all the way around the perimeter}","[3, 11]"
this is medic I think,Medic,[6]
and all that so maybe what we could do this time is try to do a b c,"Plan{topic:{try a b c},agent:{we}}/Room/Room/Room","[20, 3, 3, 3]"
this is transporter I think that's a good idea,Transporter,[5]
A3 C2 C3 and C5 a role threat Grooms so we can for well enter in,Room/Room/Room/Room,"[3, 3, 3, 3]"
all right this is engineer so have the transporter Mark every room first and then begin transporting the victims,"Engineer/Transporter/Instruction{topic:{mark every room},agent:{transporter}}/Precedence{first:{mark every room},second:{begin transporting the victims}}/Victim","[4, 5, 19, 2]"
yeah this is medic I think it might be a might be a good idea for a while engineer and I go through a b c have transported her head over to IJ k m and L and Mark those,"Medic/Plan{topic:{go through a b c}, agent:{engineer and I}}/Room/Room/Room/Room/Room/Room/Room","[6, 20, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]"

okay so I guess we can talk so I guess we can talk amongst ourselves in,0,[0]
red,Medic,[6]
okay this is so so from what we saw earlier i4a there were three critical victims it look like so I guess we should we would need three people search quickly so we can transport all three of them I guess,"CriticalVictim/HelpRequest{agent:{we}}/Precedence{first:{we would need three people search quickly},second:{we can transport all three of them I guess}}/HelpRequest{helper:{we}}/Plan{topic:{transport},agent:{we}}","[1, 16]"
yep,0,[0]
yep,0,[0]
mmm,0,[0]
that's not smart,0,[0]
okay so you want to do the same like style where we start in that top right corner I think the best way to go about is like even if it takes a little bit of time at the beginning for you two to get victims out yourselves if I'm running around and just marking doors I think we can save a lot of time not looking into rooms,"Plan{get the victim out},agent:{you}/Plan{topic:{save a lot of time},agent:{we},condition:{not looking into rooms},solution:{running around and marking doors}}",[20]
okay so you want to do the same like style where we start in that top right corner I think the best way to go about is like even if it takes a little bit of time at the beginning for you two to get victims out yourselves if I'm running around and just marking doors I think we can save a lot of time not looking into rooms,"Plan{get the victim out},agent:{you}/Plan{topic:{save a lot of time},agent:{we},condition:{not looking into rooms},solution:{running around and marking doors}}",[20]
yep,0,[0]
right,0,[0]
yeah so so the medic and I will work on trying to get as much as many victims rescue as we can and you mark off the doors and then I guess after that it wherever I see Rubble or or if you are trapped room room ceiling I'll fix that if you get stuck I will also come in help,"Plan{topic:{to get as much as many victims rescue},agent:{the medic an I}}/Instruction{topic:{mark off the deoors},agent:{you}},Precedence{first:{that}}/Plan{topioc:{fix that},agent:{I},condition:{Rubble or if you are trapped}}/Plan{topic:{help},agent:{I},condition:{you get stuck},solution:{I will come in}}",[20]

that sounds good,Instruction,[19]
mmm,0,[0]
okay,0,[0]
go team go,Instruction,[19]

yeah that's good well it's taking,Instruction,[19]
then we will put no victims right,Precedence{second:{we will put no victim}},[11]

okay so I dunno room engineer knows rooms with known damage and i4a E5 and C4 are most likely to have critical victims we also know M1 D2 and I2 are dangerous and likely to have critical victims and then possibly M3 B9 and a two,Room/Engineer/Room/Room/Room/Room/CriticalVictim/Room/Room/Room/CriticalVictim/Room/Room/CriticalVictim,"[3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1]"

okay,0,[0]
I'm not sure I might show me the same information I notice is that there's critical victims are likely to be an area the most severe damage we have like events so we have two or more attendees at a management meeting lunch a project meeting is it's just information that I'm getting are you guys seeing that to you,CriticalVictim/Meeting/Meeting,"[1, 9, 9]"
 I'm not sure it will show me the same information I noticed that there's critical victims are likely to be there yet the most severe damage we have like event so we have two or more attendees at management meetings lunch project as it's just information I'm getting are you guys saying that to you it looks like just you actually yes I'm not sure what room is correlated with what if it seems like a makes up our information so,CriticalVictim/KnowledgeSharing{exists:{critical victims}}/Meeting/Meeting,"[1, 13, 9, 9]"
 it seems like a mix of our information so I think we should start on the left hand side probably push through C2 and a tour C4 and a two and then move through the other rooms that you have marked as meeting rooms,"Instruction{topic:{shoud start on the left hand side}}/Instruction{topic:{push through}}/Room/Room/Instruction{topic:{move through}}/Precedence{first:{push through}, secod:{move through}}/Room/MarkerBlock/Room","[19, 3, 8, 3]"

transporter and sure like the first room we'll all be there but the transporter is so quick that the transporter will be able to start marking rooms ahead of us and I think it will be good for us to kind of follow the path of C the transporter instead of splitting up,"Transporter/Room/Plan{topic:{all be there}, agent:{we}}/Transporter/Transporter/Room/Transporter","[5, 3, 20, 5, 5, 3, 5]"
 this is engineer sorry and I agree with that and I think that transporter should also maybe stay a little closer to us and start cleaning up the victims and transporting them sooner than marking every single room,"Engineer/Instruction{topic:{also maybe stay a little closer to us}, agent:{transporter}}/Victim/Triage{agent:{transporter}, target:{victim}}/MarkerBlock/Room","[4, 19, 8, 3]"
