    comment: "The reason for the [!Plan] is because of the weird behavior with this construction:
    I suggest to split up and use our tools. Addendum: It's probably because the actions have a way later rulepriority
    than the communication rules. I wont mess with that now because I'm not sure if it'll break anything"
